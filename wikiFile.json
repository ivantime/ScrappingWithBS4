Straddling the border between historic Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, the city now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and is governed by Glasgow City Council. It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands.\nGlasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the \"Second City of the British Empire\" for much of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.[8][9][10][11]\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938.[12] The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. Over 985,200 people live in the Greater Glasgow contiguous urban area, while the wider Glasgow City Region is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population.[3] The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2. Natives or inhabitants are known as Glaswegians, and are well known for their distinctive dialect and accent.\nGlasgow has the largest economy in Scotland and the third-highest GDP per capita of any city in the UK.[13][14] Glasgow's major cultural institutions \u2013 the Burrell Collection, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Ballet and Scottish Opera \u2013 enjoy international reputations. The city was the European Capital of Culture in 1990 and is notable for its architecture, culture, media, music scene, sports clubs and transport connections. It is the fifth-most visited city in the United Kingdom.[15] The city hosted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at its main events venue, the SEC Centre. Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the first European Championships in 2018, and was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020. The city is also well known in the sporting world for football, particularly the Old Firm rivalry between Celtic and Rangers.\n\nContents\n\n1 Etymology\n2 History\n\n2.1 Origins and development\n2.2 Trading port\n2.3 Industrialisation\n2.4 Sanitation\n2.5 Heraldry\n\n\n3 Government and politics\n\n3.1 Local government\n3.2 Central government\n\n3.2.1 Scottish Parliament\n3.2.2 UK Westminster Parliament\n3.2.3 Referendums\n\n\n3.3 Voter turnout\n\n\n4 Geography\n\n4.1 Location\n4.2 Climate\n\n\n5 Demographics\n6 Areas and suburbs\n\n6.1 City centre\n\n6.1.1 Retail and theatre district\n6.1.2 Merchant City\n6.1.3 International Financial Services District\n\n\n6.2 West End\n6.3 East End\n6.4 South Side\n6.5 North Glasgow\n\n\n7 Culture\n\n7.1 Recreation\n7.2 Music scene\n7.3 Media\n7.4 Religion\n7.5 Language\n7.6 Architecture\n\n\n8 Economy\n9 Transport\n\n9.1 Public transport\n9.2 Shipping\n9.3 Roads\n9.4 Airports\n\n\n10 Housing\n11 Healthcare\n12 Education\n13 Sport\n\n13.1 Football\n13.2 Rugby union\n13.3 Rugby league\n13.4 Ice hockey\n13.5 Swimming\n13.6 Basketball\n13.7 Other sports\n13.8 2014 Commonwealth Games\n\n\n14 Major incidents and tragedies\n15 Namesake area on Mars\n16 Twin towns and sister cities\n\n16.1 Partnerships\n\n\n17 Notable people\n18 Notes\n19 References\n\n19.1 Citations\n19.2 Bibliography\n\n\n20 External links\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe name Glasgow is Brittonic in origin. The first element glas, meaning \"grey-green, grey-blue\" both in Brittonic and modern day Welsh and the second *c\u00f6\u00fc, \"hollow\" (c.f. Welsh glas-cau),[16] giving a meaning of \"green-hollow\".[17]  The green-hollow may refer to the ravine to the east of Glasgow Cathedral. It is often said that the name means \"dear green place\" or that \"dear green place\" is a translation from Gaelic Glas Caomh.[18]  \"The dear green place\" remains an affectionate way of referring to the city. The modern Gaelic is Glaschu and derived from the same roots as the English.\nThe settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name, Cathures; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as Glasgu. It is also recorded that the King of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the Molendinar Burn where Glasgow Cathedral now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as Glasgu.\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of Glasgow\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Glasgow history.\nOrigins and development[edit]\nThe area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the River Clyde providing a natural location for fishing. The Romans later built outposts in the area and, to protect Roman Britannia from the Brittonic speaking (Celtic) Caledonians, constructed the Antonine Wall. Items from the wall, such as altars from Roman forts like Balmuildy, can be found at the Hunterian Museum today.\nGlasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian missionary Saint Mungo in the 6th century. He established a church on the Molendinar Burn, where the present Glasgow Cathedral stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.\nGlasgow grew over the following centuries. The Glasgow Fair reportedly began in 1190.[19] The first bridge over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285, giving its name to the Briggait area of the city, forming the main north\u2013south route over the river via Glasgow Cross. The founding of the University of Glasgow in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to become the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.[20]\nFollowing the European Protestant Reformation and with the encouragement of the Convention of Royal Burghs, the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year.[20] Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of Royal Burgh in 1611.[21] Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the Atlantic triangular slave trade.[22][23]\nDaniel Defoe visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, that Glasgow was \"the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted\". At that time the city's population was about 12,000, and the city was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to its economy and urban fabric, brought about by the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.\n\nTrading port[edit]\nAfter the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. Starting in 1668, the city's Tobacco Lords created a deep water port at Port Glasgow about 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) down the River Clyde, as the river from the city to that point was then too shallow for seagoing merchant ships.[24] By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on the River Clyde, with over 47,000,000\u00a0lb (21,000\u00a0t) of tobacco being imported each year at its peak.[25] At the time, Glasgow held a commercial importance as the city participated in the trade of sugar, tobacco and later cotton.[26]\n\nIndustrialisation[edit]\n Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881\nThe opening of the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire. After extensive river engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow. The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, John Knox, James Kay, Sir Muirhead Bone, Robert Eadie and L.S. Lowry, willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world, as did Stanley Spencer downriver at Port Glasgow.\n\n The 1919 Battle of George Square\nGlasgow's population had surpassed that of Edinburgh by 1821. The development of civic institutions included the City of Glasgow Police in 1800, one of the first municipal police forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the City of Glasgow Bank's collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the \"Second City of the Empire\" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping[27] and a quarter of all locomotives in the world.[28] In addition to its pre-eminence in shipbuilding, engineering, industrial machinery, bridge building, chemicals, explosives, coal and oil industries it developed as a major centre in textiles, garment-making, carpet manufacturing, leather processing, furniture-making, pottery, food, drink and cigarette making; printing and publishing. Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.[20]\nGlasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the Lowlands and the Highlands of Scotland, from Ireland and other parts of Britain and from Continental Europe.[20] During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the Milngavie water treatment works, Glasgow Subway, Glasgow Corporation Tramways, City Chambers, Mitchell Library and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of International Exhibitions at Kelvingrove Park, in 1888, 1901 and 1911, with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the Empire Exhibition, being subsequently held in 1938 at Bellahouston Park, which drew 13 million visitors.[29]\nThe 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After World War I, the city suffered from the impact of the Post\u2013World War I recession and from the later Great Depression, this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the \"Red Clydeside\" movement. The city had recovered by the outbreak of World War II. The city saw aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe[30] during the Clydebank Blitz, during the war, then grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950s. By the 1960s, growth of industry in countries like Japan and West Germany, weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries. As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, urban decay, population decline, welfare dependency and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial Bruce Report, which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city. The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts that started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s. This involved the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.[31]\n\n Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943)\nThe city invested heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and East Kilbride, dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands to halve the city's population base.[31] By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The \"Glasgow's miles better\" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment.[32] The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, its status as European Capital of Culture in 1990,[33] and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy.[34] However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler.[35] Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas, including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration, has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of gentrification.[36] In 2008, the city was listed by Lonely Planet as one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.[37]\nDespite Glasgow's economic renaissance, the East End of the city remains the focus of social deprivation.[38] A Glasgow Economic Audit report published in 2007 stated that the gap between prosperous and deprived areas of the city is widening.[39] In 2006, 47% of Glasgow's population lived in the most deprived 15% of areas in Scotland,[39] while the Centre for Social Justice reported 29.4% of the city's working-age residents to be \"economically inactive\".[38] Although marginally behind the UK average, Glasgow still has a higher employment rate than Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.[39] In 2008 the city was ranked at 43 for Personal Safety in the Mercer index of top 50 safest cities in the world.[40] The Mercer report was specifically looking at Quality of Living, yet by 2011 within Glasgow, certain areas were (still) \"failing to meet the Scottish Air Quality Objective levels for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10)\".[41]\n\nSanitation[edit]\nWith the population growing, the first scheme to provide a public water supply was by the Glasgow Company in 1806. A second company was formed in 1812, and the two merged in 1838, but there was some dissatisfaction with the quality of the water supplied.[42] The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company began supplying water to residents living to the south of the River Clyde in 1846, obtained from reservoirs, which gave 75,000 people a constant water supply,[42] but others were not so fortunate, and some 4,000 died in an outbreak of cholera in 1848/1849.[43] This led to the development of the Glasgow Corporation Water Works, with a project to raise the level of Loch Katrine and to convey clean water by gravity along a 26\u00a0mi (42\u00a0km) aqueduct to a holding reservoir at Milngavie, and then by pipes into the city.[44] The project cost \u00a3980,000[43] and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859.[45]\nThe engineer for the project was John Frederick Bateman, while James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project, and subsequently became Engineer in Chief for Glasgow Water Commissioners. He oversaw several improvements during his tenure, including a second aqueduct and further raising of water levels in Loch Katrine.[46] Additional supplies were provided by Loch Arklet in 1902, by impounding the water and creating a tunnel to allow water to flow into Loch Katrine. A similar scheme to create a reservoir in Glen Finglas was authorised in 1903, but was deferred, and was not completed until 1965.[43] Following the 2002 Glasgow floods, the waterborne parasite cryptosporidium was found in the reservoir at Milngavie, and so the new Milngavie water treatment works was built. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth in 2007, and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for \u00a310 million below its budgeted cost.[47]\nGood health requires both clean water and effective removal of sewage. The Caledonian Railway rebuilt many of the sewers, as part of a deal to allow them to tunnel under the city, and sewage treatment works were opened at Dalmarnoch in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. The works experimented to find better ways to treat sewage, and a number of experimental filters were constructed, until a full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 at a cost of \u00a34 million.[48] Treated sludge was dumped at sea, and Glasgow Corporation owned six sludge ships between 1904 and 1998,[49] when the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive ended the practice.[50] The sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel 3.1\u00a0mi (5.0\u00a0km) long, which provides 20\u00d710^6\u00a0imp\u00a0gal (90\u00a0Ml) of storm water storage. It will reduce the risk of flooding and the likelihood that sewage will overflow into the Clyde during storms.[51] Since 2002, clean water provision and sewerage have been the responsibility of Scottish Water.[52]\n\nHeraldry[edit]\nThe coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866CrestSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.\nThe coat of arms of the City of Glasgow was granted to the royal burgh by the Lord Lyon on 25 October 1866.[53] It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date. The emblems represent miracles supposed to have been performed by Mungo[54] and are listed in the traditional rhyme:\n\nHere's the bird that never flew\nHere's the tree that never grew\nHere's the bell that never rang\nHere's the fish that never swam\nSt Mungo is also said to have preached a sermon containing the words Lord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name. This was abbreviated to \"Let Glasgow Flourish\" and adopted as the city's motto.\nIn 1450, John Stewart, the first Lord Provost of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a \"St Mungo's Bell\" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the People's Palace Museum, near Glasgow Green.\nThe supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in \"the act of benediction\". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold mural crown between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.\nThe arms were re-matriculated by the City of Glasgow District Council on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996. The only change made on each occasion was in the type of coronet over the arms.[55][56]\n\n\nGovernment and politics[edit]\nMain article: Politics of Glasgow\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

The city council was controlled by the Labour Party for over thirty years, since the decline of the Progressives. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the single transferable vote rather than the first-past-the-post system, the dominance of the Labour Party within the city started to decline. As a result of the 2017 United Kingdom local elections, the SNP was able to form a minority administration ending Labour's thirty-seven years of uninterrupted control.\nIn the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at Westminster, with one uprising in January 1919 prompting the Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, to deploy 10,000 soldiers and tanks on the city's streets. A huge demonstration in the city's George Square on 31 January ended in violence after the Riot Act was read.\nIndustrial action at the shipyards gave rise to the \"Red Clydeside\" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the Independent Labour Party. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the poll tax; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the Scottish Socialist Party, another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a Conservative MP since the 1982 Hillhead by-election, when the SDP took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the Progressives) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour Lord Provost.\nGlasgow is represented in both the House of Commons in London, and the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh. At Westminster, it is represented by seven Members of Parliament (MPs), all elected at least once every five years to represent individual constituencies, using the first-past-the-post system of voting. In Holyrood, Glasgow is represented by sixteen Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), of whom nine are elected to represent individual constituencies once every four years using first-past-the-post, and seven are elected as additional regional members, by proportional representation. Since the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Glasgow is represented at Holyrood by\n9 Scottish National Party MSPs, 4 Labour MSPs, 2 Conservative MSPs and 1 Scottish Green MSP. In the European Parliament, the city formed part of the Scotland constituency, which elected six Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) prior to Brexit.\n\nCentral government[edit]\nMain article: Glasgow Parliamentary Constituencies\nSee also: Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region) and United Kingdom constituencies\nSince Glasgow is covered and operates under two separate central governments, the devolved Scottish Parliament and UK Government, they determine various matters that Glasgow City Council is not responsible for.\n\nScottish Parliament[edit]\nThe Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament covers the Glasgow City council area, a north-western part of South Lanarkshire and a small eastern portion of Renfrewshire. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 first past the post constituency members and seven of the 56 additional members. Both kinds of member are known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The system of election is designed to produce a form of proportional representation.\nThe first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing Westminster (House of Commons) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster Members of Parliament (MPs) representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of MSPs was retained at Holyrood. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn.\nCurrently, the nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region are:\n\nGlasgow Anniesland\nGlasgow Cathcart\nGlasgow Kelvin\nGlasgow Maryhill and Springburn\nGlasgow Pollok\nGlasgow Provan\nGlasgow Shettleston\nGlasgow Southside\nRutherglen\nAt the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, all nine of these constituencies were won by Scottish National Party (SNP) candidates. On the regional vote, the Glasgow electoral region is represented by four Labour MSPs, two Conservative MSPs and one Green MSP.\n\nUK Westminster Parliament[edit]\nFollowing reform of constituencies of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom (Westminster) in 2005, which reduced the number of Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs), the current Westminster constituencies representing Glasgow are:\n\nGlasgow Central\nGlasgow East\nGlasgow North\nGlasgow North East\nGlasgow North West\nGlasgow South\nGlasgow South West\nFollowing the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which 53.49% of the electorate of Glasgow voted in favour of Scottish independence; the SNP won every constituency in the city at the 2015 general election, including a record-breaking 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP in the seat of Glasgow North East.[57]\nIn the 2017 snap election, Glasgow was represented by 6 Scottish National Party MPs and 1 Labour MP; the Glasgow North East constituency which had a record 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP at the previous general election, was regained by Paul Sweeney of the Labour Party, who narrowly defeated sitting SNP MP Anne McLaughlin by 242 votes.\nSince the 2019 snap election, Glasgow has been represented by 7 Scottish National Party MPs; the Glasgow North East constituency, was regained by Anne McLaughlin of the Scottish National Party, resulting in the same clean sweep as in 2015 general election.\n\nReferendums[edit]\nIn the Scottish independence referendum, Glasgow voted \"Yes\" by a margin of 53.5% to 46.5%.\nIn the Brexit referendum, results varied from constituency to constituency. Glasgow North recorded the biggest remain vote with 78% opting to stay in the EU whilst in Glasgow East this figure dropped to 56%.[58] The city as a whole voted to remain in the EU, by 66.6% to 33.3%.[59]\n\nVoter turnout[edit]\nVoter turnout has often been lower in Glasgow than in the rest of the United Kingdom. In the Referendum of 2014 turnout was 75%, the lowest in Scotland;[60] in the Brexit referendum the city's voters, while joining the rest of Scotland in voting to remain part of the EU, again had a low turnout of 56.2%, although SNP MP Angus Robertson placed this in the historical context of traditional low turnout in Glasgow.[61]\nIn the 2015 general election, the six Scottish constituencies with the lowest turnout were all in Glasgow;[62] turnout further decreased in the 2017 election, when five of the city's seven seats reported a lowered turnout.[63]\n\nGeography[edit]\nMain article: Geography of Glasgow\nGlasgow is located on the banks of the River Clyde, in West Central Scotland. Another important river is the Kelvin, a tributary of the River Clyde, whose name was used in creating the title of Baron Kelvin the renowned physicist for whom the SI unit of temperature, Kelvin, is named.\nOn older maps Glasgow is shown within the area of the pre-1975 county of Lanarkshire; from 1975 to 1996 it appears within Strathclyde Region; more recent maps generally show Glasgow as one of 32 Council Areas in Scotland.\n\n River Clyde, west of Glasgow city centre as seen from the air\nLocation[edit]\nDestinations from Glasgow\nDumbarton, Helensburgh, Crianlarich\nAberfoyle, Callander, Crianlarich\nCumbernauld, Stirling (30\u00a0mi or 48\u00a0km), Falkirk (24\u00a0mi or 39\u00a0km)\n\n\n\n\n\nErskine, Paisley (9.3\u00a0mi or 15\u00a0km), Renfrew, Port Glasgow, Greenock\n\nGlasgow\n\nCoatbridge, Airdrie, Livingston (30\u00a0mi or 48\u00a0km), Edinburgh (47\u00a0mi or 76\u00a0km)\n\n\n\n\n\nKilmarnock, Prestwick, Ayr\nEast Kilbride (9.9\u00a0mi or 16\u00a0km), Strathaven, Cumnock, Dumfries\nMotherwell, Hamilton, Lanark, Wishaw, Carluke\n\nGlasgow is located in the central belt of Scotland.\n\nClimate[edit]\n Panorama over Glasgow's South Side and West End from Queen's Park, looking north west. Left of centre can be seen the Clyde Arc bridge at Finnieston, while beyond is the tower of the University of Glasgow, with the Campsie Fells in the distance on the right.\nDespite its northerly latitude, similar to that of Moscow, Glasgow's climate is classified as oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb).\nData is available online for 3 official weather stations in the Glasgow area: Paisley, Abbotsinch and Bishopton. All are located to the west of the city, in neighbouring Renfrewshire.\nOwing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Winter temperatures are usually higher than in most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to continental Western Europe. At Paisley, the annual precipitation averages 1,245\u00a0mm (49.0\u00a0in). Glasgow has been named as the rainiest city of the UK, having an average of 170 days of rain a year.[64][65]\nWinters are cool and overcast, with a January mean of 5.0\u00a0\u00b0C (41.0\u00a0\u00b0F), though lows sometimes fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C (10\u00a0\u00b0F) in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.\nDuring the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F), and very rarely exceed 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.\nThe official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe. The warmest month on record in the data series is July 2006, with an average high of 22.7\u00a0\u00b0C (72.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and low of 13.7\u00a0\u00b0C (56.7\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] Even this extreme event only matched a normal summer on similar parallels in continental Europe, underlining the maritime influences. The coldest month on record since the data series began is December 2010, during a severe cold wave affecting the British Isles. Even then, the December high was above freezing at 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C (34.9\u00a0\u00b0F) with the low of \u22124.4\u00a0\u00b0C (24.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] This still ensured Glasgow's coldest month of 2010 remained milder than the isotherm of \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F) normally used to determine continental climate normals.\nTemperature extremes have ranged from \u221219.9\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F), at Abbotsinch in December 1995 to[67]\n31.9\u00a0\u00b0C (89\u00a0\u00b0F) at Bishopton in June 2018.[68]\n\n\n\n\n\nvteClimate data for Paisley[a], elevation: 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft) 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1959\u2013present\n\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n\nRecord high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n13.5(56.3)\n\n14.4(57.9)\n\n17.2(63.0)\n\n24.4(75.9)\n\n26.5(79.7)\n\n29.6(85.3)\n\n30.0(86.0)\n\n31.0(87.8)\n\n26.7(80.1)\n\n22.8(73.0)\n\n17.7(63.9)\n\n14.1(57.4)\n\n31.0(87.8)\n\n\nAverage high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n7.2(45.0)\n\n7.8(46.0)\n\n9.8(49.6)\n\n13.0(55.4)\n\n16.1(61.0)\n\n18.4(65.1)\n\n19.8(67.6)\n\n19.3(66.7)\n\n16.7(62.1)\n\n13.0(55.4)\n\n9.6(49.3)\n\n7.4(45.3)\n\n13.2(55.8)\n\n\nDaily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n4.6(40.3)\n\n5.0(41.0)\n\n6.5(43.7)\n\n9.0(48.2)\n\n11.8(53.2)\n\n14.3(57.7)\n\n15.9(60.6)\n\n15.6(60.1)\n\n13.3(55.9)\n\n9.9(49.8)\n\n6.9(44.4)\n\n4.7(40.5)\n\n9.8(49.6)\n\n\nAverage low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n2.1(35.8)\n\n2.2(36.0)\n\n3.2(37.8)\n\n5.1(41.2)\n\n7.4(45.3)\n\n10.3(50.5)\n\n12.1(53.8)\n\n11.9(53.4)\n\n9.9(49.8)\n\n6.8(44.2)\n\n4.2(39.6)\n\n2.1(35.8)\n\n6.5(43.7)\n\n\nRecord low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n\u221214.8(5.4)\n\n\u22127.5(18.5)\n\n\u22128.3(17.1)\n\n\u22124.4(24.1)\n\n\u22121.1(30.0)\n\n1.5(34.7)\n\n3.9(39.0)\n\n2.2(36.0)\n\n\u22120.2(31.6)\n\n\u22123.5(25.7)\n\n\u22126.8(19.8)\n\n\u221214.5(5.9)\n\n\u221214.8(5.4)\n\n\nAverage precipitation mm (inches)\n\n146.4(5.76)\n\n115.2(4.54)\n\n97.4(3.83)\n\n66.1(2.60)\n\n68.8(2.71)\n\n67.8(2.67)\n\n82.9(3.26)\n\n94.8(3.73)\n\n98.4(3.87)\n\n131.8(5.19)\n\n131.8(5.19)\n\n161.4(6.35)\n\n1,262.8(49.72)\n\n\nAverage precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm)\n\n17.7\n\n14.7\n\n13.8\n\n12.3\n\n12.1\n\n12.1\n\n13.3\n\n13.9\n\n13.9\n\n16.2\n\n17.3\n\n16.9\n\n174.3\n\n\nMean monthly sunshine hours\n\n38.6\n\n67.3\n\n104.3\n\n141.4\n\n186.8\n\n155.6\n\n151.5\n\n145.5\n\n114.6\n\n86.3\n\n53.9\n\n33.7\n\n1,279.6\n\n\nSource 1: Met Office [69]\n\n\nSource 2: KNMI/Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute[70]\n\n\n\n\n\nvteClimate data for Abbotsinch[b], elevation: 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1951\u2013present\n\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n\nRecord high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n13.5(56.3)\n\n14.3(57.7)\n\n18.9(66.0)\n\n24.0(75.2)\n\n27.4(81.3)\n\n29.6(85.3)\n\n30.1(86.2)\n\n31.2(88.2)\n\n26.7(80.1)\n\n23.9(75.0)\n\n16.0(60.8)\n\n14.6(58.3)\n\n31.2(88.2)\n\n\nAverage high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n6.7(44.1)\n\n7.4(45.3)\n\n9.2(48.6)\n\n12.2(54.0)\n\n15.4(59.7)\n\n17.8(64.0)\n\n19.3(66.7)\n\n18.9(66.0)\n\n16.5(61.7)\n\n12.8(55.0)\n\n9.3(48.7)\n\n6.8(44.2)\n\n12.7(54.9)\n\n\nDaily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n4.1(39.4)\n\n4.5(40.1)\n\n5.9(42.6)\n\n8.2(46.8)\n\n10.9(51.6)\n\n13.6(56.5)\n\n15.3(59.5)\n\n14.9(58.8)\n\n12.9(55.2)\n\n9.6(49.3)\n\n6.4(43.5)\n\n4.1(39.4)\n\n9.2(48.6)\n\n\nAverage low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n1.5(34.7)\n\n1.6(34.9)\n\n2.6(36.7)\n\n4.2(39.6)\n\n6.5(43.7)\n\n9.4(48.9)\n\n11.2(52.2)\n\n10.9(51.6)\n\n9.2(48.6)\n\n6.4(43.5)\n\n3.6(38.5)\n\n1.4(34.5)\n\n5.7(42.3)\n\n\nRecord low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n\u221217.4(0.7)\n\n\u221215.0(5.0)\n\n\u221212.5(9.5)\n\n\u22125.4(22.3)\n\n\u22123.9(25.0)\n\n1.2(34.2)\n\n0.8(33.4)\n\n1.1(34.0)\n\n\u22124.0(24.8)\n\n\u22127.1(19.2)\n\n\u221210.4(13.3)\n\n\u221219.9(\u22123.8)\n\n\u221219.9(\u22123.8)\n\n\nAverage precipitation mm (inches)\n\n157.3(6.19)\n\n125.0(4.92)\n\n112.4(4.43)\n\n73.2(2.88)\n\n71.9(2.83)\n\n80.8(3.18)\n\n91.9(3.62)\n\n107.1(4.22)\n\n109.4(4.31)\n\n135.7(5.34)\n\n145.0(5.71)\n\n160.7(6.33)\n\n1,370.2(53.94)\n\n\nAverage precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm)\n\n18.2\n\n15.2\n\n14.9\n\n12.6\n\n12.2\n\n12.8\n\n13.4\n\n14.5\n\n14.3\n\n17.2\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\n181.2\n\n\nMean monthly sunshine hours\n\n45.9\n\n70.0\n\n106.1\n\n148.2\n\n197.2\n\n159.2\n\n162.7\n\n152.9\n\n117.9\n\n84.9\n\n57.5\n\n41.7\n\n1,344.1\n\n\nSource: Met Office[71]\n\n\nDemographics[edit]\n Greater Glasgow population density map\nMain articles: Demography of Glasgow and Geography of Glasgow \u00a7\u00a0Demographics\nFurther information: Glasgow effect\nIn the 1950s, the population of the City of Glasgow area peaked at 1,089,000. Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the Gorbals and relocation to \"new towns\" such as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld led to population decline. In addition, the boundaries of the city were changed twice during the late-twentieth century, making direct comparisons difficult.\nThe urban area continues to expand beyond the city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, encompassing around 400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,040\u00a0km2) of all adjoining suburbs, if commuter towns and villages are included.[72] There are two distinct definitions for the population of Glasgow: the Glasgow City Council Area which lost the districts of Rutherglen and Cambuslang to South Lanarkshire in 1996, and the Greater Glasgow Urban Area which includes the conurbation around the city (however in the 2016 definitions[73] the aforementioned Rutherglen and Cambuslang were included along with the likes of Paisley, Clydebank, Newton Mearns, Bearsden and Stepps but not others with no continuity of populated postcodes \u2013 although in some cases the gap is small \u2013 the excluded nearby settlements including Barrhead, Erskine and Kirkintilloch plus a large swathe of Lanarkshire which had been considered contiguous with Glasgow in previous definitions: the 'settlements' named Coatbridge & Airdrie, Hamilton and Motherwell & Wishaw, each containing a number of distinct smaller localities).[3]\n\n\n\nLocation\n\nPopulation\n\nArea\n\nDensity\n\n\nGlasgow City Council[74]\n\n592,820\n\n67.76\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (175.5\u00a0km2)\n\n8,541.8/sq\u00a0mi (3,298.0/km2)\n\n\nGreater Glasgow Urban Area[3]\n\n985,290\n\n265\u00a0km2 (102\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n\n3,775/km2 (9,780/sq\u00a0mi)\n\n\nSource: Scotland's Census Results Online[75]\n\nGlasgow's population influx in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was related to economic expansion as well as internally generated growth with the vast majority of newcomers to the city from outside Scotland being from Ireland, especially the north western counties of Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Londonderry. In the 1881 UK Census, 83% of the population was born in Scotland, 13% in Ireland, 3% in England and 1% elsewhere. By 1911, the city was no longer gaining population by migration. The demographic percentages in the 1951 UK census were: born in Scotland 93%, Ireland 3%, England 3% and elsewhere 1%.[20] In the early twentieth century, many Lithuanian refugees began to settle in Glasgow and at its height in the 1950s; there were around 10,000 in the Glasgow area.[76] Many Italian Scots also settled in Glasgow, originating from provinces like Frosinone in Lazio and Lucca in north-west Tuscany at this time, many originally working as \"Hokey Pokey\" men.[77]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population of Glasgow and city limits\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population and city limits\n\n\nYear[78]\n\nPopulation\n\nArea  (km2)\n\nDensity  (inhabitants/km2)\n\nArea changes\n\n\n1300\n1,500\n-[79]\n\u2013\nInitial\n\n\n1600\n7,000\n\u2013\n\u2013\nUnknown\n\n\n1791\n66,000\n7.16\n9,217\nAnderson to James Street/West Nile Street to Camlachie\n\n\n1831\n202,426\n8.83\n22,924\nNecropolis and Blythswood\n\n\n1846\n280,000\n23.44\n11,945\nBurghs of Anderston and Calton/Barony of Gorbals\n\n\n1872\n494,824\n24.42\n20,263\nDistricts of Keppochhill, Alexandra Parade and the new Glasgow University grounds\n\n\n1891\n658,073\n48.00\n13,709\nBurghs of Govanhill, Crosshill, Pollokshields, Maryhill and Hillhead.

The population of the city council area was 593,245 in 2011[82] and around 2,300,000 people live in the Glasgow travel to work area.[83] This area is defined as consisting of over 10% of residents travelling into Glasgow to work and is without fixed boundaries.[84]\nThe population density of London following the 2011 census was recorded as 5,200 people per square kilometre, while 3,395 people per square kilometre were registered in Glasgow.[85][86] In 1931, the population density was 16,166/sq\u00a0mi (6,242/km2), highlighting the \"clearances\" into the suburbs and new towns that were built to reduce the size of one of Europe's most densely populated cities.[87]\nIn 2005, Glasgow had the lowest life expectancy of any UK city at 72.9 years.[88] Much was made of this during the 2008 Glasgow East by-election.[89] In 2008, a World Health Organization report about health inequalities, revealing that male life expectancy varied from 54 years in Calton to 82 years in nearby Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire.[90][91]\n\nAreas and suburbs[edit]\n Areas of Glasgow. Click to enlarge.\nCity centre[edit]\n The Clyde Arc, also known locally as the \"Squinty Bridge\"\nThe city centre is bounded by High Street up to Glasgow Cathedral at Castle Street, Glasgow Cross, Saltmarket including Glasgow Green and St Andrew's Square to the east; Clyde Street and Broomielaw (along the River Clyde) to the south; and Charing Cross and Elmbank Street, beyond Blythswood Square to the west.  The northern boundary (from east to west) follows Cathedral Street to North Hanover Street and George Square.\n\nRetail and theatre district[edit]\n Looking down Buchanan Street towards St Enoch subway station\nThe city centre is based on a grid system of streets on the north bank of the River Clyde. The heart of the city is George Square, site of many of Glasgow's public statues and the elaborate Victorian Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of Glasgow City Council. To the south and west are the shopping precincts of Argyle Street, Sauchiehall Street and Buchanan Street, the last featuring more upmarket retailers and winner of the Academy of Urbanism \"Great Street Award\" 2008.[92] The collection of shops around these streets accumulate to become known as \"The Style Mile\".[93]\nThe main shopping areas include Buchanan Street, Buchanan Galleries, linking Buchanan Street and Sauchiehall Street,  and the St. Enoch Centre linking Argyle Street and St Enoch Square), with the up-market Princes Square, which specifically features shops such as Ted Baker, Radley and Kurt Geiger.[94]  Buchanan Galleries and other city centre locales were chosen as locations for the 2013 film Under the Skin directed by Jonathan Glazer.[95] Although the Glasgow scenes were shot with hidden cameras, star Scarlett Johansson was spotted around town.[96] The Italian Centre in Ingram Street also specialises in designer labels. Glasgow's retail portfolio forms the UK's second largest and most economically important retail sector after Central London.[97][98]\nThe city centre is home to most of Glasgow's main cultural venues: the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow City Hall, Theatre Royal (performing home of Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet), the Pavilion Theatre, the King's Theatre, Glasgow Film Theatre, Tron Theatre, Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), Mitchell Library and Theatre, the Centre for Contemporary Arts, McLellan Galleries and the Lighthouse Museum of Architecture. The world's tallest cinema, the eighteen-screen Cineworld, is situated on Renfrew Street.\nThe city centre is also home to four of Glasgow's higher education institutions: the University of Strathclyde, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow School of Art and Glasgow Caledonian University, and to the largest college in Britain the City of Glasgow College in Cathedral Street.\n\nMerchant City[edit]\n The Tolbooth Steeple dominates Glasgow Cross and marks the east side of the Merchant City.\nThis is the commercial and part-residential district of the Merchant City, a name coined by the historian Charles Oakley in the 1960s. This had started as a residential district of the wealthy city merchants involved in international trade and the textile industries in the 18th and early 19th centuries, with their warehouses nearby, including the Tobacco Lords from whom many of the streets take their name. With its mercantile wealth, and continuing growth even before the Industrial Revolution, the city expanded by creating the New Town around George Square, soon followed by the New Town of Blythswood on Blythswood Hill which includes Blythswood Square.[99] The original medieval centre around Glasgow Cross and the High Street was left behind.\nGlasgow Cross, situated at the junction of High Street, leading up to Glasgow Cathedral, Gallowgate, Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its Mercat cross. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Steeple, all that remains of the original Glasgow Tolbooth, which was demolished in 1921. Moving northward up High Street towards Rottenrow and Townhead lies the 15th century Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand's Lordship. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.[100]\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre flats and warehouse conversions. This regeneration has supported an increasing number of caf\u00e9s and restaurants.[101] The area is also home to a number of high end boutique style shops and some of Glasgow's most upmarket stores.[102]\nThe Merchant City is one centre of Glasgow's growing \"cultural quarter\", based on King Street, the Saltmarket and Trongate, and at the heart of the annual Merchant City Festival. The area has supported a growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces.[103] The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a \"cultural quarter\" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and Glasgow City Council,[103] and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both.[104] The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the Tron Theatre, the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the City Halls.[105]\n\nInternational Financial Services District[edit]\nFurther information: International Financial Services District\n The International Financial Services District alongside the River Clyde\nTo the western edge of the city centre, occupying the areas of Blythswood Hill and Anderston, lies Glasgow's financial district, known officially as the International Financial Services District (IFSD), although often irreverently nicknamed by the contemporary press as the \"square kilometre\" or \"Wall Street on Clyde\".[106] Since the late 1980s the construction of many modern office blocks and high rise developments have paved the way for the IFSD to become one of the UK's largest financial quarters. With a reputation as an established financial services centre, coupled with comprehensive support services, Glasgow continues to attract and grow new business.\nOf the 10 largest general insurance companies in the UK, 8 have a base or head office in Glasgow\u00a0\u2014 including Direct Line, Esure, AXA and Norwich Union. Key banking sector companies have also moved some of their services to commercial property in Glasgow\u00a0\u2013 Resolution, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays Wealth, Tesco Personal Finance, Morgan Stanley, Lloyds Banking Group, Clydesdale Bank, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Santander and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Ministry of Defence have several departments and Clydeport, the Glasgow Stock Exchange, Student Loans Company, Scottish Executive Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, BT Group, Scottish Friendly. Scottish Qualifications Authority and Scottish Enterprise also have their headquarters in the district. Royal Dutch Shell also have one of their six worldwide Shared Business Centres located in the IFSD. Hilton have a corporate office based in the area.\n\nWest End[edit]\n Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is Glasgow's premier museum and art gallery, housing one of Europe's best civic art collections.\nGlasgow's West End grew firstly to and around Blythswood Square and Garnethill, extending then to Woodlands Hill and Great Western Road. It is a district of elegant townhouses and tenements with caf\u00e9s, tea rooms, bars, boutiques, upmarket hotels, clubs and restaurants in the hinterland of Kelvingrove Park, the University of Glasgow, Glasgow Botanic Gardens and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, focused especially on the area's main thoroughfares of Argyle Street (Finnieston), Great Western Road and Byres Road. The area is popular with tourists and students.\nThe West End includes residential areas of Hillhead, Dowanhill, Kelvingrove, Kelvinside, Hyndland, Broomhill, Scotstoun, Jordanhill, Kelvindale and Anniesland\nand, to an increasing extent, Partick. The name is also increasingly being used to refer to any area to the west of Charing Cross. The West End is bisected by the River Kelvin, which flows from the Campsie Fells in the north and confluences with the River Clyde at Yorkhill Quay.\nThe spire of Sir George Gilbert Scott's Glasgow University main building (the second largest Gothic Revival building in Great Britain) is a major landmark, and can be seen from miles around, sitting atop Gilmorehill. The university itself is the fourth oldest in the English-speaking world. Much of the city's student population is based in the West End, adding to its cultural vibrancy.\nThe area is also home to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Kelvin Hall museums and research facilities, stores, and community sport.  Adjacent to the Kelvin Hall was the Museum of Transport, which reopened in 2010 after moving to a new location on a former dockland site at Glasgow Harbour where the River Kelvin flows into the Clyde. The new building is built to a design by Zaha Hadid. The West End Festival, one of Glasgow's largest festivals, is held annually in June.\nGlasgow is the home of the SECC, Great Britain's largest exhibition and conference centre.[107][108][109] On 30 September 2013, a major expansion of the SECC facilities at the former Queen's Dock by Foster and Partners officially opened \u2013 the 13,000-seat Hydro arena. Adjacent to the SECC at Queen's Dock is the Clydeside distillery, a Scotch whisky distillery that opened in 2017 in the former dock pump house.[110]\n\nEast End[edit]\n People's Palace museum on Glasgow Green\nThe East End extends from Glasgow Cross in the City Centre to the boundary with North and South Lanarkshire. It is home to the Glasgow Barrowland market, popularly known as \"The Barras\",[111] Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow Green, and Celtic Park, home of Celtic FC. Many of the original sandstone tenements remain in this district. The East End was once a major industrial centre, home to Sir William Arrol & Co., James Templeton & Co and William Beardmore and Company. A notable local employer continues to be the Wellpark Brewery, home of Tennent's Lager.\nThe Glasgow Necropolis Garden Cemetery was created by the Merchants House on a hill above the cathedral in 1831. Routes curve through the landscape uphill to the 21.3-metre-high (70\u00a0ft)[112] statue of John Knox at the summit. There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by David Dale, whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern Gillespie, Kidd & Coia building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as \"Homes for the Future\", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.[113]\nEast of Glasgow Cross is St Andrew's in the Square, the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739\u20131757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy tobacco merchants. Also close by is the more modest Episcopalian St Andrew's-by-the-Green, the oldest Episcopal church in Scotland. The Episcopalian St Andrew's was also known as the \"Whistlin' Kirk\" due to it being the first church after the Reformation to own an organ.\n\n The Doulton Fountain\u00a0[de] in Glasgow Green\nOverlooking Glasgow Green is the fa\u00e7ade of Templeton On The Green, featuring vibrant polychromatic brickwork intended to evoke the Doge's Palace in Venice.[114]\nThe extensive Tollcross Park was originally developed from the estate of James Dunlop, the owner of a local steelworks. His large baronial mansion was built in 1848 by David Bryce, which later housed the city's Children's Museum until the 1980s. Today, the mansion is a sheltered housing complex.\nThe new Scottish National Indoor Sports Arena, a modern replacement for the Kelvin Hall, is in Dalmarnock. The area was the site of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, located adjacent to the new indoor sports arena.\nThe East End Healthy Living Centre (EEHLC) was established in mid-2005 at Crownpoint Road with Lottery Funding and City grants to serve community needs in the area. Now called the Glasgow Club Crownpoint Sports Complex, the centre provides service such as sports facilities, health advice, stress management, leisure and vocational classes.[115] To the north of the East End lie the two large gasometers of Provan Gas Works, which stand overlooking Alexandra Park and a major interchange between the M8 and M80 motorways.[116][117][118]\n\nSouth Side[edit]\n Pacific Quay sits within the south side of Glasgow, and is home to some of the city's largest businesses and employers.\nGlasgow's South Side sprawls out south of the Clyde. The adjoining urban area includes some of Greater Glasgow's most affluent suburban towns, such as Newton Mearns, Clarkston, and Giffnock, all of which are in East Renfrewshire, as well as Thorntonhall in South Lanarkshire. Newlands and Dumbreck are examples of high-value residential districts within the city boundaries. There are many areas containing a high concentration of sandstone tenements, examples being Battlefield, Govanhill, Mount Florida and Shawlands. The large suburb of Pollokshields comprises both a quiet western part with undulating tree-lined boulevards lined with expensive villas, and a busier eastern part with a high-density grid of tenements and small shops. The south side also includes some post-war housing estates of various sizes such as Toryglen, Pollok, Castlemilk and Arden. The towns of Cambuslang and Rutherglen were included in the City of Glasgow district from 1975 to 1996, but are now in the South Lanarkshire council area.[119][120][121]\nAlthough predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Scotland Street School Museum and House for an Art Lover; the Burrell Collection in Pollok Country Park; Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson's Holmwood House villa; the National Football Stadium Hampden Park in Mount Florida (home of Queens Park FC) and Ibrox Stadium (home of Rangers FC).\nThe former docklands site at Pacific Quay on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the Glasgow Science Centre and the headquarters of BBC Scotland and STV Group (owner of STV), in a new purpose built digital media campus.\nIn addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built, including the Clyde Arc known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at Pacific Quay and others at Tradeston and Springfield Quay.\nThe South Side also includes many public parks, including Linn Park, Queen's Park, and Bellahouston Park and several golf clubs, including the championship course at Haggs Castle. The South Side is also home to the large Pollok Country Park, which was awarded the accolade of Europe's Best Park 2008.[122] The southside also directly borders Rouken Glen Park in neighbouring Giffnock. Pollok Park is Glasgow's largest park and until the early 2000s was the only country park in the city's boundary. In the early 2000s the Dams to Darnley Country Park was designated, although half of the park is in East Renfrewshire. As of 2021 the facilities at the still new park are quite lacking.\nGovan is a district and former burgh in the south-western part of the city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is home to one of two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system. The wider Govan area includes the districts of Ibrox, Cessnock, Kinning Park and Kingston.\n\nNorth Glasgow[edit]\n Ruchill Church, seen from the Forth and Clyde Canal\nNorth Glasgow extends out from the north of the city centre towards the affluent suburbs of Bearsden, Milngavie and Bishopbriggs in East Dunbartonshire and Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire. The area also contains some of the city's poorest residential areas. Possilpark is one such district, where levels of unemployment and drug abuse continue to be above the national average. Much of the housing in areas such as Possilpark and Hamiltonhill have fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years.[citation needed]\nThis has led to large-scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in north Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as Ruchill, which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern housing estates. Much of the housing stock in north Glasgow is rented social housing, with a high proportion of high-rise tower blocks, managed by the North Glasgow Housing Association trading as NG Homes and Glasgow Housing Association.\nMaryhill consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the north of the city, containing affluent areas such as Maryhill Park and North Kelvinside. Maryhill is also the location of Firhill Stadium, home of Partick Thistle F.C. since 1909. The junior team, Maryhill F.C. are also located in this part of north Glasgow.\nThe Forth and Clyde Canal passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy. It was for many years polluted and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation have seen it rejuvenated, including art campuses at Port Dundas.\nSighthill was home to Scotland's largest asylum seeker community but the area is now regenerated as part of the Youth Olympic Games bid.[123]\nA huge part of the economic life of Glasgow was once located in Springburn, where the Saracen Foundry, engineering works of firms like Charles Tennant and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the North British Locomotive Company. Today part of the Glasgow Works continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn. It is proposed for closure in 2019.[124]\n\nCulture[edit]\nSee also: Culture in Glasgow\n Established by wealthy tobacco merchant Stephen Mitchell, the Mitchell Library is now one of the largest public reference libraries in Europe\nThe city has many amenities for a wide range of cultural activities, from curling to opera and ballet and from football to art appreciation; it also has a large selection of museums that include those devoted to transport, religion, and modern art. Many of the city's cultural sites were celebrated in 1990 when Glasgow was designated European Capital of Culture.[125]\nThe city's principal municipal library, the Mitchell Library, has grown into one of the largest public reference libraries in Europe, currently housing some 1.3\u00a0million books, an extensive collection of newspapers and thousands of photographs and maps.[126]\nOf academic libraries, Glasgow University Library started in the 15th century and is one of the oldest and largest libraries in Europe, with unique and distinctive collections of international status.[127]\nMost of Scotland's national arts organisations are based in Glasgow, including Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, National Theatre of Scotland, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Scottish Youth Theatre.\nGlasgow has its own \"Poet Laureate\", a post created in 1999 for Edwin Morgan[128] and occupied by Liz Lochhead from 2005[129] until 2011, when she stood down to take up the position of Scots Makar.[130] Jim Carruth was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate for Glasgow in 2014 as part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy.[131]\nIn 2013, PETA declared Glasgow to be the most vegan-friendly city in the UK.[132]\n\nRecreation[edit]\nSee also: Glasgow Festivals\nGlasgow is home to a variety of theatres including the King's Theatre, the Theatre Royal and the Citizens Theatre and is home to many museums and art galleries, the largest and most famous being the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) and the Burrell Collection. Most of the museums and galleries in Glasgow are publicly owned and free to enter.\nThe city has hosted many exhibitions over the years, including The Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988,  being the UK City of Architecture 1999, European Capital of Culture 1990, National City of Sport 1995\u20131999 and European Capital of Sport 2003. Glasgow has also hosted the National M\u00f2d no less than twelve times since 1895.[133]\nIn addition, unlike the older and larger Edinburgh Festival (where all Edinburgh's main festivals occur in the last three weeks of August), Glasgow's festivals fill the calendar. Festivals include the Glasgow International Comedy Festival, Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art, Glasgow International Jazz Festival, Celtic Connections, Glasgow Fair, Glasgow Film Festival, West End Festival, Merchant City Festival, Glasgay, and the World Pipe Band Championships.\n\nMusic scene[edit]\nSee also: List of bands from Glasgow\n The OVO Hydro arena is the second-busiest arena venue in the world.[134]\nThe city is home to numerous orchestras, ensembles and bands including those of Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and related to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the Universities and Colleges. Choirs of all type are well supported.\nGlasgow has many live music venues, pubs, and clubs. Some of the city's more well-known venues include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, The OVO Hydro, the SECC, Glasgow Cathouse, The Art School, King Tut's Wah Wah Hut (where Oasis were spotted and signed by Glaswegian record mogul Alan McGee), the Queen Margaret Union (who have Kurt Cobain's footprint locked in a safe), the Barrowland, a ballroom converted into a live music venue as well as The Garage, which is the largest nightclub in Scotland. More recent mid-sized venues include ABC, destroyed in the art school fire of 15 June 2018, and the O2 Academy, which play host to a similar range of acts. There are also a large number of smaller venues and bars, which host many local and touring musicians, including Stereo, 13th Note and Nice N Sleazy. Most recent recipient of the SLTN Music Pub of the Year award was Bar Bloc, awarded in November 2011.[135] In 2010, Glasgow was named the UK's fourth \"most musical\" city by PRS for Music.[136] Glasgow is also the \"most mentioned city in the UK\" in song titles, outside London according, to a chart produced by PRS for music, with 119, ahead of closest rivals Edinburgh who received 95 mentions[137]\n\n View of the entrance to the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall\nSince the 1980s, the success of bands such as The Blue Nile, Gun, Simple Minds, Del Amitri, Texas, Hipsway, Love & Money, Idlewild, Deacon Blue, Orange Juice, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, Teenage Fanclub, Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, Franz Ferdinand, Mogwai, Travis, and Primal Scream has significantly boosted the profile of the Glasgow music scene, prompting Time magazine to liken Glasgow to Detroit during its 1960s Motown heyday.[138] More recent[when?] successes include The Fratellis, Chvrches, Rustie, Vukovi, Glasvegas and Twin Atlantic. The city of Glasgow was appointed a UNESCO City of Music on 20 August 2008 as part of the Creative Cities Network.\nGlasgow's contemporary dance music scene has been spearheaded by Slam, and their record label Soma Quality Recordings,[139] with their Pressure club nights attracting DJs and clubbers from around the world, which was previously held at The Arches but following that venue's closure due to claims of unsafe level of drug use has moved to Sub Club.\nThe MOBO Awards were held at the SECC on 30 September 2009, making Glasgow the first out-of-London city to host the event since its launch in 1995. On 9 November 2014, Glasgow hosted the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards at The OVO Hydro, it was the second time Scotland hosted the show since 2003 in Edinburgh and overall the fifth time that the United Kingdom has hosted the show since 2011 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The event was hosted by Nicki Minaj and featured performances from Ariana Grande, Enrique Iglesias, Ed Sheeran, U2 and Slash.\n\nMedia[edit]\nMain article: Media in Glasgow\n Glasgow is home to the HQ of BBC Scotland in Pacific Quay\n STV has its HQ located in Glasgow\nThere have been hundreds of films made about Glasgow or in Glasgow.[140]\nBoth BBC Scotland and STV have their headquarters in Glasgow. Television programs filmed in Glasgow include Rab C. Nesbitt, Taggart, Tutti Frutti, High Times, River City, City Lights, Chewin' the Fat, Still Game, Limmy's Show and Lovesick. Most recently the long-running series Question Time and the early evening quiz programme Eggheads moved its production base to the city. Most National Lottery game shows are also filmed in Glasgow. children's game show Copycats is filmed there, and the Irish/UK programme Mrs. Brown's Boys is filmed at BBC Scotland.\nThe Scottish press publishes various newspapers in the city such as The Evening Times , The Herald, The Sunday Herald, the Sunday Mail and the Daily Record. Scottish editions of Trinity Mirror and News International titles are printed in the city. STV Group is a Glasgow-based media conglomerate with interests in television, and publishing advertising. STV Group owns and operates both Scottish ITV franchises (Central Scotland and Grampian), both branded STV. Glasgow also had its own television channel, STV Glasgow, which launched in June 2014, which also shows some of Glasgow's own programs filmed at the STV headquarters in Glasgow. Shows included The Riverside Show, Scottish Kitchen, City Safari, Football Show and Live at Five. STV Glasgow merged with STV Edinburgh to form STV2 in April 2017 which eventually closed in June 2018.\nVarious radio stations are also located in Glasgow. BBC Radio Scotland, the national radio broadcaster for Scotland, is located in the BBC's Glasgow headquarters alongside its Gaelic-language sister station, which is also based in Stornoway. Bauer Radio owns the principal commercial radio stations in Glasgow: Clyde 1 and Clyde 2, which can reach over 2.3\u00a0million listeners.[141] In 2004, STV Group plc (then known as SMG plc) sold its 27.8% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings to the broadcasting group EMAP for \u00a390.5\u00a0million.

The Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church are the two largest Christian denominations in the city. There are 147 congregations in the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow (of which 104 are within the city boundaries, the other 43 being in adjacent areas).[142] Within the city boundaries there are 65 parishes of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow[143] and four parishes of the Diocese of Motherwell.[144] The city has four Christian cathedrals: Glasgow Cathedral, of the Church of Scotland; St Andrew's Cathedral, of the Roman Catholic Church; St Mary's Cathedral, of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and St Luke's Cathedral, of the Greek Orthodox Church. The Baptist Church and Salvation Army are well represented.\n\n Glasgow Cathedral marks the site where Saint Mungo built his church and established Glasgow\nThe Protestant churches are the largest in number, including Baptist, Episcopalian, Methodist and Presbyterian. 32% of the population follow the Protestant Church of Scotland whilst 29% following the Roman Catholic Church, according to the 2001 census (Christians overall form 65%).[145] Much of the city's Roman Catholic population are those of Irish ancestry. The divisions between the two denominations and their respective communities play a major part in sectarianism in Glasgow, in a similar nature to that of Northern Ireland, although not segregated territorially as in Belfast.[146][147]\nBiblical unitarians are represented by three Christadelphian ecclesias, referred to geographically, as \"South\",[148] \"Central\"[149] and \"Kelvin\".[150]\nThe Sikh community is served by four Gurdwaras. Two are situated in the West End (Central Gurdwara Singh Sabha in Sandyford and Guru Nanak Sikh Temple in Kelvinbridge) and two in the Southside area of Pollokshields (Guru Granth Sahib Gurdwara and Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Gurdwara). In 2013, Scotland's first purpose-built Gurdwara opened in a massive opening ceremony. Built at a cost of \u00a33.8M, it can hold 1,500 worshippers.[151] Central Gurdwara is currently constructing a new building in the city. There are almost 10,000 Sikhs in Scotland and the majority live in Glasgow.[152]\nGlasgow Central Mosque in the Gorbals district is the largest mosque in Scotland and, along with twelve other mosques in the city, caters for the city's Muslim population, estimated to number 33,000.[153]\nGlasgow also has a Hindu mandir.\nGlasgow has seven synagogues, including the Romanesque-revival Garnethill Synagogue in the city centre. Glasgow currently has the seventh largest Jewish population in the United Kingdom after London, Manchester, Leeds, Gateshead, Brighton and Bournemouth but once had a Jewish population second only to London, estimated at 20,000 in the Gorbals alone.[154]\nIn 1993, the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art opened in Glasgow. It is believed to be the only public museum to examine all the world's major religious faiths.[155][156]\n\nLanguage[edit]\nGlasgow is Scotland's main locus of Gaelic language use outside the Highlands and Islands. In 2011, 5,878 residents of the city over age 3 spoke Gaelic, amounting to 1.0% of the population. Of Scotland's 25 largest cities and towns, only Inverness, the unofficial capital of the Highlands, has a higher percentage of Gaelic speakers.[157] In the Greater Glasgow area there were 8,899 Gaelic-speakers, amounting to 0.8% of the population.[158] Both the Gaelic language television station BBC Alba and the Gaelic language radio station BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal have studios in Glasgow, their only locations outside the Highlands and Islands.[159]\n\nArchitecture[edit]\nMain article: Architecture in Glasgow\nClockwise, from upper left: The People's Palace is an example of 19th-century architecture within the city centre of Glasgow. The People's Palace is a Category A listed building. The SEC Armadillo opened in 1997 and is considered an iconic Glasgow structure, frequently being used as an image to represent the city nationally and internationally. The Glasgow Science Centre and Glasgow Tower in the Pacific Quay area of the city, an example of modern design within the city as part of regeneration efforts. New high-rise apartment blocks have been constructed through Glasgow, such as on the banks of the River Clyde to replace the ageing Glasgow tower blocks constructed during the 1960s.\nVery little of medieval Glasgow remains; the two main landmarks from this period being the 15th-century Provand's Lordship and 13th-century St. Mungo's Cathedral, although the original medieval street plan (along with many of the street names) on the eastern side of the city centre has largely survived intact. Also in the 15th century began the building of Cathcart Castle, completed c. 1450 with an impressive view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle Mary Queen of Scots supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the Battle of Langside in May 1568. The castle was demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the central city area as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of Victorian architecture: the Glasgow City Chambers; the main building of the University of Glasgow, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott; and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, designed by Sir John W. Simpson, are notable examples.\nThe city is notable for architecture designed by the Glasgow School, the most notable exponent of that style being Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mackintosh was an architect and designer in the Arts and Crafts Movement and the main exponent of Art Nouveau in the United Kingdom, designing numerous noted Glasgow buildings such as the Glasgow School of Art, Willow Tearooms and the Scotland Street School Museum. A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the Queen's Cross Church, the only church by the renowned artist to be built.[160]\nAnother architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance is Alexander Thomson, with notable examples including the Holmwood House villa, and likewise Sir John James Burnet, awarded the R.I.B.A.'s Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the \"Second City of the Empire\". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The shipyards, marine engineering, steel making, and heavy industry all contributed to the growth of the city.\nMany of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond sandstone, but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the furnaces, until the Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956. In recent years many of these buildings have been cleaned and restored to their original appearance.[citation needed] There are over 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over 1,471 hectares (3,630 acres). Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields \u2013 the first major planned garden suburb in Britain \u2013 Newlands and the village of Carmunnock.[161]\nModern buildings in Glasgow include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and along the banks of the Clyde are the Glasgow Science Centre, The OVO Hydro and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, whose Clyde Auditorium was designed by Sir Norman Foster, and is colloquially known as the \"Armadillo\". In 2006 Zaha Hadid won a competition to design the new Museum of Transport.[162] Hadid's museum opened on the waterfront in 2011 and has been renamed the Riverside Museum to reflect the change in location and to celebrate Glasgow's rich industrial heritage stemming from the Clyde.[163]\nGlasgow's impressive historical and modern architectural traditions were celebrated in 1999 when the city was designated UK City of Architecture and Design,[164] winning the accolade over Liverpool and Edinburgh.[165]\n\nEconomy[edit]\n RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, better known as the QE2, was built in Glasgow at the John Brown Shipyard on the River Clyde.\n RMS\u00a0Queen Mary is largely regarded as a sign of Glaswegian powerhouse shipbuilding industry.\nGlasgow has the largest economy in Scotland[13] and is at the hub of the metropolitan area of West Central Scotland. Glasgow also has the third highest GDP Per capita of any city in the UK (after London and Edinburgh).[14][needs update] The city itself sustains more than 410,000 jobs in over 12,000 companies. Over 153,000 jobs were created in the city between 2000 and 2005\u00a0\u2013 a growth rate of 32%.[166] Glasgow's annual economic growth rate of 4.4% is now second only to that of London. In 2005, over 17,000 new jobs were created, and 2006 saw private-sector investment in the city reaching \u00a34.2\u00a0billion, an increase of 22% in a single year.[167] 55% of the residents in the Greater Glasgow area commute to the city every day. Once dominant export orientated manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding and other heavy engineering have been gradually replaced in importance by more diversified forms of economic activity, although major manufacturing firms continue to be headquartered in the city, such as Aggreko, Weir Group, Clyde Blowers, Howden, Linn Products, Firebrand Games, William Grant & Sons, Whyte and Mackay, The Edrington Group, British Polar Engines and Albion Motors.[168]\nGlasgow was once one of the most significant cities in the UK for manufacturing, which generated a great deal of the city's wealth; the most prominent industry being shipbuilding based on the River Clyde.[169] Among the historic vessels constructed there were the famed tea clipper Cutty Sark, the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS\u00a0Hood, and the transatlantic luxury liners Aquitania, RMS\u00a0Queen Mary, RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth, and RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II. Although Glasgow owed much of its economic growth to the shipbuilding industry, which still continues today in the form of Ferguson Marine and BAE Systems Maritime - Naval Ships' two shipyards, the city has its roots in the tobacco trade and is noted to have \"risen from its medieval slumber\" from trade in tobacco, pioneered by figures such as John Glassford.[170] The city was also noted for its locomotive construction industry\u2014led by firms such as the North British Locomotive Company\u2014which grew during the 19th century before entering a decline in the 1960s.\n\n A view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employers\nWhilst manufacturing has declined, Glasgow's economy has seen significant relative growth of tertiary sector industries such as financial and business services (centred around the International Financial Services District on the Broomielaw, once a stretch of riverside warehouses replaced by modern office blocks), communications, biosciences, creative industries, healthcare, higher education, retail and tourism.[171] Glasgow is now the second most popular foreign tourist destination in Scotland (fifth in the UK)[172] and offers Scotland's largest retail centre.\nBetween 1998 and 2001, the city's financial services sector grew at a rate of 30%, making considerable gains on Edinburgh, which has historically been the centre of the Scottish financial sector.[173][174] Glasgow is now one of Europe's sixteen largest financial centres,[175] with a growing number of Blue chip financial sector companies establishing significant operations or headquarters in the city.[176]\nThe 1990s and first decade of the 21st century saw substantial growth in the number of call centres based in Glasgow. In 2007 roughly 20,000 people, a third of all call centre employees in Scotland, were employed by Glasgow call centres.[177] This growth and its high use of recruitment agencies to hire graduates as temporary workers has led to accusations of exploitative practices such as long hours, poor pay and lack of job security by the TUC and other union bodies.[178] In recent years some call centres have taken steps to rectify this criticism.[citation needed]\nThe city's main manufacturing industries include companies involved in; shipbuilding, engineering, construction, brewing and distilling, printing and publishing, chemicals and textiles as well as newer growth sectors such as optoelectronics, software development and biotechnology.[179] Glasgow forms the western part of the Silicon Glen high tech sector of Scotland with consumer electronics companies such as RHA Technologies headquartered.\n\nTransport[edit]\nSee also: transport in Glasgow\nPublic transport[edit]\n Glasgow Central station is the northern terminus of the West Coast Main Line.\nGlasgow has a large urban transport system, mostly managed by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT). \n\n Glasgow Queen Street station is the main connection for rail services to Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands.\nThe city has many bus services; since bus deregulation almost all are provided by private operators, though SPT part-funds some services. The principal bus operators within the city are: First Glasgow, McGill's Bus Services, Stagecoach West Scotland and Glasgow Citybus. The main bus terminal in the city is Buchanan bus station.\n\nGlasgow has the most extensive urban rail network in the UK outside London, with rail services travelling to a large part of the West of Scotland. Most lines were electrified under British Rail. All trains running within Scotland, including the local Glasgow trains, are operated by ScotRail, which is owned by the Scottish Government. Central station and Queen Street station are the two main railway terminals. Glasgow Central is the terminus of the 642\u00a0km (399\u00a0mi) long West Coast Main Line[180] from London Euston, as well as TransPennine Express services from Manchester and CrossCountry services from Birmingham, Bristol, Plymouth and various other destinations in England. Glasgow Central is also the terminus for suburban services on the south side of Glasgow, Ayrshire and Inverclyde, as well as being served by the cross city link from Dalmuir to Motherwell. Most other services within Scotland\u00a0\u2013 the main line to Edinburgh, plus services to Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and the Western Highlands\u00a0\u2013 operate from Queen Street station.  Buchanan Bus Station is the main bus terminal within Glasgow.\nThe city's suburban network is currently divided by the River Clyde and the Crossrail Glasgow initiative has been proposed to link them; it is currently awaiting funding from the Scottish Government. The city is linked to Edinburgh by four direct railway links. In addition to the suburban rail network, SPT operates the Glasgow Subway. The Subway is the United Kingdom's only completely underground metro system and is generally recognised as the world's third oldest underground railway after the London Underground and the Budapest Metro.[181] Both railway and subway stations have a number of park and ride facilities.\nAs part of the wider regeneration along the banks of the River Clyde, a bus rapid transit system called Clyde Fastlink is operational between Glasgow City Centre to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.[182]\n\n\nShipping[edit]\nGlobal-ship-management is carried out by maritime and logistics firms in Glasgow, in client companies employing over 100,000 seafarers. This reflects maritime skills over many decades and the training and education of deck officers and marine engineers from around the world at the City of Glasgow College, Nautical Campus, from which graduate around one third of all such graduates in the United Kingdom.[183]\nThe main operational dock within Glasgow operated by Clydeport is the King George V Dock, near Braehead. Since the advent of containerisation, most other facilities, such as Hunterston Terminal, are located in the deep waters of the Firth of Clyde, which together handle some 7.5\u00a0million tonnes of cargo each year. Longer distant commercial sea shipping from Glasgow occurs regularly to many European destinations, including Mediterranean and Baltic ports via passage through the Sea of the Hebrides.[184]\nLeisure and tourist sailing is important, at marinas and towns of the Clyde, including the PS Waverley, the world's last operational seagoing paddle-steamer.[185]\n\nRoads[edit]\n The M8, which crosses the Clyde over the Kingston Bridge, is Scotland's busiest motorway. The main M8 motorway passes around the city centre and connects with the M77, M74, M73 and M80 motorways, all of which pass within the city's boundaries. The A82 connects Glasgow to Argyll and the western Highlands. The M74 runs directly south towards Carlisle.\nOther strategic roads in the city include the East End Regeneration Route, which provides easier access to areas of the East End, linking the M8 to the extended M74.\n\nAirports[edit]\nThe city has three international airports within 45 minutes travel of the city centre, as well as a centrally located seaplane terminal. Two are dedicated to Glasgow while the third is Edinburgh International which, as it is situated on the west side of Edinburgh, is relatively close to Glasgow. These airports are Glasgow Airport (GLA) (eight\u00a0mi or thirteen\u00a0km west of the city centre) in Renfrewshire, Glasgow Prestwick Airport (PIK) (30\u00a0mi or 50\u00a0km southwest) in Ayrshire, Edinburgh Airport (EDI), (34\u00a0mi or 55\u00a0km east) in Edinburgh and Glasgow Seaplane Terminal, by the Glasgow Science Centre on the River Clyde. There are also several smaller, domestic and private airports around the city. There is a heliport, Glasgow City Heliport, located at Stobcross Quay on the banks of the Clyde.\nAll of the international airports are easily accessible by public transport, with GLA and EDI directly linked by a bus routes from the main bus station and a direct rail connection to PIK from Glasgow Central Station. A series of proposals to provide a direct rail link to Glasgow International Airport have ended unsuccessfully, beginning with the Glasgow Airport Rail Link in 2009.[186] As of 2019, local authorities have approved plans for a \"Glasgow Metro\", including a connection to the International Airport.[187]\n\nHousing[edit]\nMain article: Housing in Glasgow\n Typical red sandstone Glasgow terrace\nGlasgow is known for its tenements; the red and blond sandstone buildings are some of the most recognisable features of the city.[188] These were the most popular form of housing in 19th- and 20th-century Glasgow, and remain the most common form of dwelling in Glasgow today. Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, high ceilings and original period features.[189] The Hyndland area of Glasgow became the first tenement conservation area in the UK[190] and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.\nLike many cities in the UK, Glasgow witnessed the construction of high-rise housing in tower blocks in the 1960s, along with large overspill estates on the periphery of the city, in areas like Pollok, Nitshill, Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Milton and Drumchapel.[191] These were built to replace the decaying inner-city tenement buildings originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, to feed the local demand for labour.[192] The massive demand at that time outstripped the pace of new building, and many originally fine tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary.[193] Many degenerated into infamous slums, such as the Gorbals.\n\n 20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough Road\nEfforts to improve this housing situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust in the late 19th century, cleared the slums of the old town areas such as the Trongate, High Street and Glasgow Cross.[194] Subsequent urban renewal initiatives, such as those motivated by the Bruce Report, entailed the comprehensive demolition of slum tenement areas, the development of new towns on the periphery of the city, and the construction of tower blocks.\nThe policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful.[195] Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s[195] and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed many fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.[189] The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396\u00a0million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.[196]\n\nHealthcare[edit]\n Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the largest hospital campus in Europe.\nMedical care is mainly provided by NHS Scotland and is directly administered by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\nMajor hospitals, including those with Accident & Emergency provision, are: the Western Infirmary, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Dental Hospital in the city Centre, Stobhill Hospital in the North and the Victoria Infirmary and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in the South Side. Gartnavel Royal Hospital and The Priory are the two major psychiatric hospitals based in Glasgow.\nThe Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) Campus is a 1,677-bed acute hospital located in Govan in the south-west of Glasgow. The hospital is built on the site of the former Southern General Hospital and opened at the end of April 2015. The hospital comprises a newly built 1,109-bed adult hospital, a 256-bed children's hospital and two major A&E departments, one for adults and one for children in addition to buildings retained from the former hospital. The QEUH is the Regional Major Trauma Centre for the west of Scotland[197] and is also the largest hospital campus in Europe.[198]\nThere is also an emergency telephone service provided by NHS 24 and 24-hour access to general practitioners through out-of-hours centres. Paramedic services are provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service and supported by voluntary bodies like the St. Andrew's Ambulance Association. A strong teaching tradition is maintained between the city's main hospitals and the University of Glasgow Medical School.\nAll pharmacies provide a wide range of services including minor ailment advice, emergency hormonal contraception, public health advice, some provide oxygen and needle exchange.\nThere are private clinics and hospitals at the Nuffield in the west end and Ross Hall in the south side of the city.\nOn weekend evenings, when the statutory medical services are under most pressure, a charitable team of medical volunteers from Glasgow Street Aid patrol the city centre offering welfare and medical assistance, as well as onward medical referrals to those requiring it. This allows for minor ailments and injuries to be attended to, generally without the attendance of an emergency ambulance. The charity also responds to major medical emergencies upon request, where life support can be administered whilst further assistance from the ambulance service can be sought.[199]\n\nEducation[edit]\n The University of Glasgow is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and among the world's top 100 universities.\nGlasgow is a major centre of higher and academic research, with the following universities and colleges within 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) of the city centre:\n\nUniversity of Glasgow[200]\nUniversity of Strathclyde[201]\nGlasgow Caledonian University[202]\nUniversity of the West of Scotland[203]\nThe Glasgow School of Art[204]\nRoyal Conservatoire of Scotland[205]\nCity of Glasgow College[183]\nGlasgow Clyde College[206]\nGlasgow Kelvin College[207]\nWest College Scotland[208]\nIn 2011 Glasgow had 53,470 full-time students aged 18\u201374 resident in the city during term time, more than any other city in Scotland and the fifth-highest number in the United Kingdom outside London.[209] The majority of those who live away from home reside in Shawlands, Dennistoun and the West End of the city.[210]\nThe City Council operates 29 secondary schools, 149 primary schools and three specialist schools\u00a0\u2013 the Dance School of Scotland, Glasgow School of Sport and the Glasgow Gaelic School (Sgoil Gh\u00e0idhlig Ghlaschu), the only secondary school in Scotland to teach exclusively in Gaelic. Outdoor Education facilities are provided by the city council at the Blairvadach Centre, near Helensburgh. Jordanhill School is operated directly by the Scottish Government. Glasgow also has a number of Independent schools, including The High School of Glasgow, founded in 1124 and the oldest school in Scotland; Hutchesons' Grammar School, founded in 1639 and one of the oldest school institutions in Britain; and others such as Craigholme School (closed 2020), Glasgow Academy, Kelvinside Academy and St. Aloysius' College. Glasgow is part of the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities.[211]\n\nSport[edit]\nSee also: Sport in Glasgow\nFootball[edit]\nMain article: History of football in Scotland\n Glasgow is home to Hampden Park, home of the Scotland national football team.\nThe world's first international football match was held in 1872 at the West of Scotland Cricket Club's Hamilton Crescent ground in the Partick area of the city. The match, between Scotland and England finished 0\u20130.\nGlasgow was the first city (since joined by Liverpool in 1985, Madrid in 1986, 2014, 2016 and 2018, Milan in 1994 and London in 2019) to have had two football teams in European finals in the same season:[212] in 1967, Celtic competed in the European Cup final with rivals Rangers competing in the Cup Winners' Cup final. Rangers were the first football club from the United Kingdom to reach a European final, doing so in 1961. They have also won more domestic top-tier league titles than any other football club in the world (currently 55). Celtic were the first non-Latin club to win the European Cup, under the management of Jock Stein in 1967, before Manchester United the following year. Celtic also went on to reach another European Cup Final in 1970, losing to Feyenoord, and also the final of the UEFA Cup in 2003, where they lost an enthralling match which finished 3\u20132 to Portuguese club Porto. Rangers also reached the final of the same competition in 2008, where they lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg of Russia.\nHampden Park, which is Scotland's national football stadium, holds the European record for attendance at a football match: 149,547[213] saw Scotland beat England 3\u20131 in 1937, in the days before leading British stadia became all-seated. Hampden Park has hosted the final of the UEFA Champions League on three occasions, most recently in 2002 and hosted the UEFA Cup Final in 2007. Celtic Park (60,411 seats) is located in the east end of Glasgow, and Ibrox Stadium (50,817 seats) on the south side.\nGlasgow has four professional football clubs, who all play in the SPFL: Celtic, Rangers, Partick Thistle, and Queen's Park (after their move from amateur status in November 2019). Prior to this, Glasgow had two other professional teams: Clyde (since moved to Cumbernauld) and Third Lanark (liquidated in 1967), plus four others active in the league in the 19th century: Thistle, Cowlairs, Northern and Linthouse. There are a number of West of Scotland Football League clubs within the city as well, such as Pollok, Maryhill, Benburb, Ashfield, Glasgow Perthshire F.C., Glasgow United (formerly Shettleston Juniors), and Petershill, plus numerous amateur teams.\nThe history of football in the city, as well as the status of the Old Firm, attracts many visitors to football matches in the city throughout the season. The Scottish Football Association, the national governing body, and the Scottish Football Museum are based in Glasgow, as are the Scottish Professional Football League, Scottish Junior Football Association and Scottish Amateur Football Association. The Glasgow Cup was a once popular tournament, which was competed for by Rangers, Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle and Queen's Park. The competition is now played for by the youth sides of the five teams.\nGlasgow is also home to six women's football teams. Currently, Glasgow City are the champions of the Scottish Women's Premier League.[214] Other local teams include Glasgow Girls and the women's sections of the men's clubs: Celtic and Rangers play in the top division.\n\n\n\nClub\n\nFounded\n\nLeague\n\nVenue\n\nCapacity\n\n\nCeltic F.C.\n\n1888\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nCeltic Park\n\n60,411[215]\n\n\nRangers F.C.\n\n1872\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nIbrox Stadium\n\n50,817[216]\n\n\nPartick Thistle F.C.\n\n1876\n\nScottish Championship\n\nFirhill Stadium\n\n10,102[217]\n\n\nQueen's Park F.C.\n\n1867\n\nScottish Championship\n\nFirhill Stadium\n\n10,102[218]\n\nRugby union[edit]\nGlasgow has a professional rugby union club, the Glasgow Warriors, which plays in the European Rugby Champions Cup and Pro14 alongside teams from Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Italy and South Africa. The Warriors current home is Scotstoun Stadium and has been since 2012, previously they played at Firhill Stadium. They have won the Melrose 7s in both 2014 and 2015 and were also crowned champions of the Pro12 at the end of the 2014/15 season after beating Irish side Munster in Belfast.\nIn the Scottish League, Glasgow Hawks RFC was formed in 1997 by the merger of two of Glasgow's oldest clubs: Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow High Kelvinside (GHK). Despite the merger, the second division teams of Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow High Kelvinside re-entered the Scottish rugby league in 1998.\nSouth of Glasgow, in East Renfrewshire, in the suburb of Giffnock, is based another of Glasgow area's most prominent clubs Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC (GHA). GHA was formed in 2002 with the merger of two of Glasgow's leading clubs at the time, Glasgow Southern RFC and Hutchesons Aloysians RFC.\nCartha Queen's Park play at Dumbreck, within the city.\nGlasgow was also home to one of the oldest rugby clubs in Scotland,[219] West of Scotland F.C., which was formed in 1865, and was a founding member of the Scottish Rugby Union. The club was originally based in Partick at Hamilton Crescent but is now based outside the city, at Burnbrae, Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire.\n\nRugby league[edit]\nThe Easterhouse Panthers based in the East End of Glasgow are a rugby league team who play in the Rugby League Conference Scotland Division. Scotstoun Stadium has also hosted many rugby league tournaments/events.\n\nIce hockey[edit]\nThe City of Glasgow has a number of ice rinks, and a temporary one is set up in George Square in the Christmas period.\nFrom 1966 to 1986, the Glasgow Dynamos played at Crossmyloof Ice Rink.[220] Since October 2010 a team called the Glasgow Clan based in the nearby Braehead Arena in Renfrewshire has played in the professional Elite Ice Hockey League alongside two other Scottish teams, the Fife Flyers and the Dundee Stars. This is the first time that a top level ice hockey team has represented Glasgow.\n\nSwimming[edit]\nThe Arlington Baths Club was founded in 1870. It is situated in the Woodlands area of the city and is still in use today. It is believed the club's first Baths Master William Wilson invented water polo at the club. The Arlington inspired other Swimming Clubs and the Western Baths, which opened in 1876, is also still in existence in nearby Hillhead. Most of Glasgow's Victorian and Edwardian Municipal Pools have been closed or demolished, with the city council investing in large new leisure centres such as Tollcross, Springburn, Gorbals, Scotstoun and Bellahouston. A community group is however hoping to re-open Govanhill Baths, on the city's southside.\n\nBasketball[edit]\nGlasgow hosts Scotland's only professional basketball team, the Glasgow Rocks, who compete in the British Basketball League. Previously based in Renfrewshire's Braehead Arena and the 1,200-seat Kelvin Hall, the team has been based at the Emirates Arena since the 2012/13 season.\n\nOther sports[edit]\n Emirates Arena in Glasgow, one of the designated stadiums constructed for the 2014 Commonwealth Games\nMajor international sporting arenas include the Kelvin Hall and Scotstoun Sports Centre. In 2003 the National Academy for Badminton was completed in Scotstoun. In 2003, Glasgow was also given the title of European Capital of Sport.[221]\nGlasgow is also host to many cricket clubs including Clydesdale Cricket Club who have been title winners for the Scottish Cup many times. This club also acted as a neutral venue for a One Day International match between India and Pakistan in 2007, but due to bad weather it was called off.\nSmaller sporting facilities include an abundance of outdoor playing fields, as well as golf clubs such as Haggs Castle and artificial ski slopes. Between 1998 and 2004, the Scottish Claymores American football team played some or all of their home games each season at Hampden Park and the venue also hosted World Bowl XI.\nGlasgow Green and the Gorbals are home to a number of rowing clubs, some with open membership the rest belonging to universities or schools. Historically, rowing races on the River Clyde here attracted huge crowds of spectators to watch regattas in the late 19th century and early 20th century;[222] before football caught the public imagination. Two of Glasgow's rowing clubs separately claim that it was their members who were among the founders of Rangers Football Club.[223]\nMotorcycle speedway racing was first introduced to Glasgow in 1928 and is currently staged at Ashfield Stadium in the North of the city. The home club, Glasgow Tigers, compete in the SGB Championship, the second tier of motorcycle speedway in Britain.\nGlasgow is also one of five places in Scotland that hosts the final of the Scottish Cup of Shinty, better known as the Camanachd Cup. This is usually held at Old Anniesland. Once home to numerous Shinty clubs, there is now only one senior club in Glasgow, Glasgow Mid-Argyll, as well as two university sides from University of Strathclyde and University of Glasgow.\nGlasgow bid to host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics but lost to Buenos Aires in the 4 July 2013 vote.[224]\nGlasgow was the host of the 2018 European Sports Championships along with Berlin (hosts of the 2018 European Athletics Championships).\n\n2014 Commonwealth Games[edit]\nSee also: 2014 Commonwealth Games\nOn 9 November 2007, Glasgow was selected to be the host city of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The games were held at a number of existing and newly constructed sporting venues across the city, including a refurbished Hampden Park, Kelvingrove Park, Kelvin Hall, and the OVO Hydro at the SECC. The opening ceremony was held at Celtic Park. 2014 was the third time the Games have been held in Scotland.[225][226]\n\nMajor incidents and tragedies[edit]\n The aftermath of the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack, the first terrorist attack to take place in Scotland since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988\n5 April 1902 \u2013 1902 Ibrox disaster \u2013 25 spectators died and more than 500 were injured when a new wooden stand at the Ibrox Park stadium collapsed during an England\u2013Scotland match.[227]\n1960s/1970s \u2013 Many perished at three major blazes: the Cheapside Street whisky bond fire in Cheapside Street, Anderston (1960, 19 killed);[228] the James Watt Street fire (1968, 22 killed);[229] and the Kilbirnie Street fire (1972, seven killed).[230]\n2 January 1971 \u2013 1971 Ibrox disaster \u2013 66 people were killed in a crush, as supporters attempted to vacate the stadium.\n11 May 2004 \u2013 Stockline Plastics factory explosion \u2013 The ICL Plastics factory (commonly referred to as Stockline Plastics factory), in the Woodside district of Glasgow, exploded. Nine people were killed, including two company directors, and 33 injured \u2013 15 seriously. The four-storey building was largely destroyed.\n30 June 2007 \u2013 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack \u2013 Two jihadist terrorists\u2014Bilal Abdullah and Kafeel Ahmed\u2014deliberately drove a Jeep Cherokee SUV loaded with propane cylinders into the glass doors of a crowded terminal at Glasgow International Airport in an attempted suicide attack. A concrete security pillar blocked the car from entering the terminal. The two perpetrators were both apprehended; Ahmed died of burn wounds sustained in the attack, while Abdullah was convicted in Woolwich Crown Court of conspiracy to murder through terrorism and was sentenced to at least 32 years' imprisonment.[231][232] The perpetrators were also linked to a failed car bombing in London the previous day. Ahmed's brother Sabeel Ahmed pleaded guilty to failing to disclose information about an act of terrorism and was deported.[232]\n29 November 2013 \u2013 2013 Glasgow helicopter crash \u2013 A Eurocopter EC135-T2+ police helicopter (operated by Bond Air Services for Police Scotland) crashed on top of The Clutha Vaults Bar in Glasgow City Centre, killing all aboard the helicopter (the pilot and two crew members) and seven people in the pub. The cause of the crash was fuel starvation due to pilot error.[233][234]\n23 May 2014 \u2013 Glasgow School of Art blaze \u2013 A fire tore through the historic and world-renowned Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh building, that was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Around a tenth of the structure and 30% of its contents were destroyed, including the prized Mackintosh Library. There were no deaths but a few were treated for minor smoke inhalation. The Scottish Fire and Rescue were praised for their quick response and plan to effectively tackle the fire. It was later found after a fire investigation that gases inside a projector had overheated and ignited.\n22 December 2014 \u2013 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash \u2013 Six people were killed and many were seriously injured when a bin lorry careened out of control and collided with pedestrians, vehicles, and buildings, on Queen Street, Glasgow, before crashing into the Millennium Hotel. The subsequent fatal accident inquiry established that the driver had suffered a \"neurocardiogenic syncope\" (fainting) episode that caused him to lose control of his vehicle.[235][236]\n29 December 2014 \u2013 first Ebola virus case in Scotland \u2013 Pauline Cafferkey, a nurse returning to Glasgow from Kerry Town treatment centre, Sierra Leone, West Africa where she had been a volunteer caring for patients infected with the Ebola virus was taken into isolation after testing positive for the virus. She was not diagnosed before leaving Sierra Leone.\n15 June 2018 \u2013 A fire once again broke out in the partially restored Glasgow School of Art, causing extensive damage. The School was widely criticised for failing to install an effective modern sprinkler system in a timely manner. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19 pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire. No casualties were reported. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown.\nNamesake area on Mars[edit]\nThere is an area on Planet Mars which NASA has named Glasgow, after Scotland's largest city.

fourth-most populous city in the United Kingdom, as well as being the 27th largest city by population in Europe.[7] In 2020, it had an estimated population of 635,640. Straddling the border between historic Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, the city now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and is governed by Glasgow City Council. It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands.\nGlasgow/\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a, \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a//\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a, \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a//\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a, \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a/\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a\u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028aGLAHZ-goh, GLAZ-gohGLAHZ-goh, GLAZ-gohGLAHZGLAZScotsGlesca or GlesgaScottish GaelicGlaschumost populouscityScotlandfourth-most populous cityUnited KingdomEurope[7][7]historicLanarkshireRenfrewshirecouncil areas of ScotlandGlasgow City CouncilRiver ClydeWest Central LowlandsGlasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the \"Second City of the British Empire\" for much of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.[8][9][10][11]\nmedievalbishopricroyal burghUniversity of GlasgowScottish EnlightenmentNorth AmericaWest IndiesIndustrial Revolutionshipbuildingmarine engineeringBritish EmpireVictorianEdwardian eras[8][8][9][9][10][10][11][11]In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938.[12] The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. Over 985,200 people live in the Greater Glasgow contiguous urban area, while the wider Glasgow City Region is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population.[3] The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2. Natives or inhabitants are known as Glaswegians, and are well known for their distinctive dialect and accent.\n[12][12]urban renewalnew townsCumbernauldLivingstonEast KilbrideGreater GlasgowGlasgow City Region[3][3]locality2dialect and accentGlasgow has the largest economy in Scotland and the third-highest GDP per capita of any city in the UK.[13][14] Glasgow's major cultural institutions \u2013 the Burrell Collection, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Ballet and Scottish Opera \u2013 enjoy international reputations. The city was the European Capital of Culture in 1990 and is notable for its architecture, culture, media, music scene, sports clubs and transport connections. It is the fifth-most visited city in the United Kingdom.[15] The city hosted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at its main events venue, the SEC Centre. Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the first European Championships in 2018, and was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020. The city is also well known in the sporting world for football, particularly the Old Firm rivalry between Celtic and Rangers.\neconomy in Scotland[13][13][14][14]Burrell CollectionKelvingrove Art

The first element glas, meaning \"grey-green, grey-blue\" both in Brittonic and modern day Welsh and the second *c\u00f6\u00fc, \"hollow\" (c.f. Welsh glas-cau),[16] giving a meaning of \"green-hollow\".[17]  The green-hollow may refer to the ravine to the east of Glasgow Cathedral. It is often said that the name means \"dear green place\" or that \"dear green place\" is a translation from Gaelic Glas Caomh.[18]  \"The dear green place\" remains an affectionate way of referring to the city. The modern Gaelic is Glaschu and derived from the same roots as the English.\nBrittonicglasBrittonicWelsh*c\u00f6\u00fcWelshglas-cau[16][16][17][17]Glas Caomh[18][18]GlaschuThe settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name, Cathures; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as Glasgu. It is also recorded that the King of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the Molendinar Burn where Glasgow Cathedral now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as Glasgu.\nCathuresGlasguKing of StrathclydeRhydderch HaelMolendinar BurnGlasgow CathedralGlasguHistory[edit]History[edit][edit]Main article: History of GlasgowHistory of GlasgowFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Glasgow history.Timeline of Glasgow historyOrigins and development[edit]Origins and development[edit][edit]The area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the River Clyde providing a natural location for fishing. The Romans later built outposts in the area and, to protect Roman Britannia from the Brittonic speaking (Celtic) Caledonians, constructed the Antonine Wall. Items from the wall, such as altars from Roman forts like Balmuildy, can be found at the Hunterian Museum today.\nRiver ClydeRomansBritanniaBrittonic speakingCelticCaledoniansAntonine WallRoman fortsBalmuildyHunterian MuseumGlasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian missionary Saint Mungo in the 6th century. He established a church on the Molendinar Burn, where the present Glasgow Cathedral stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.\nGlasgow grew over the following centuries. The Glasgow Fair reportedly began in 1190.[19] The first bridge over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285, giving its name to the Briggait area of the city, forming the main north\u2013south route over the river via Glasgow Cross. The founding of the University of Glasgow in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to become the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.[20]\nmissionarySaint MungoMolendinar BurnGlasgow CathedralGlasgow Fair[19][19]first bridgeGlasgow CrossUniversity of GlasgowbishopricArchdiocese of Glasgow[20][20]Following the European Protestant Reformation and with the encouragement of the Convention of Royal Burghs, the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year.[20] Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of Royal Burgh in 1611.[21] Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the Atlantic triangular slave trade.[22][23]\nReformationConvention of Royal Burghs[20][20]Royal Burgh[21][21]Atlantic triangular slave trade[22][22][23][23]Daniel Defoe visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, that Glasgow was \"the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted\". At that time the city's population was about 12,000, and the city was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to its economy and urban fabric, brought about by the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.\nDaniel DefoeA tour thro' the whole island of Great BritainA tour thro' the whole island of Great BritainScottish EnlightenmentTrading port[edit]Trading port[edit][edit]After the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. Starting in 1668, the city's Tobacco Lords created a deep water port at Port Glasgow about 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) down the River Clyde, as the river from the city to that point was then too shallow for seagoing merchant ships.[24] By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on the River Clyde, with over 47,000,000\u00a0lb (21,000\u00a0t) of tobacco being imported each year at its peak.[25] At the time, Glasgow held a commercial importance as the city participated in the trade of sugar, tobacco and later cotton.[26]\nActs of UnionTobacco LordsPort GlasgowRiver Clyde[24][24][25][25][26][26]Industrialisation[edit]Industrialisation[edit][edit] Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881 Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881Shipping on the ClydeAtkinson GrimshawThe opening of the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire. After extensive river engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow. The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, John Knox, James Kay, Sir Muirhead Bone, Robert Eadie and L.S. Lowry, willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world, as did Stanley Spencer downriver at Port Glasgow.\nMonkland CanalForth and Clyde CanalPort DundasLanarkshireriver engineeringRobert NapierJohn ElderGeorge ThomsonSir William PearceSir Alfred YarrowJohn Atkinson GrimshawJohn KnoxJames KaySir Muirhead BoneRobert EadieL.S.

The development of civic institutions included the City of Glasgow Police in 1800, one of the first municipal police forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the City of Glasgow Bank's collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the \"Second City of the Empire\" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping[27] and a quarter of all locomotives in the world.[28] In addition to its pre-eminence in shipbuilding, engineering, industrial machinery, bridge building, chemicals, explosives, coal and oil industries it developed as a major centre in textiles, garment-making, carpet manufacturing, leather processing, furniture-making, pottery, food, drink and cigarette making; printing and publishing. Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.[20]\nCity of Glasgow PolicepoliceCity of Glasgow Bank[27][27][28][28][20][20]Glasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the Lowlands and the Highlands of Scotland, from Ireland and other parts of Britain and from Continental Europe.[20] During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the Milngavie water treatment works, Glasgow Subway, Glasgow Corporation Tramways, City Chambers, Mitchell Library and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of International Exhibitions at Kelvingrove Park, in 1888, 1901 and 1911, with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the Empire Exhibition, being subsequently held in 1938 at Bellahouston Park, which drew 13 million visitors.[29]\nLowlandsHighlands of ScotlandIrelandContinental Europe[20][20]Milngavie water treatment worksGlasgow SubwayGlasgow Corporation TramwaysCity ChambersMitchell LibraryKelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumInternational ExhibitionsKelvingrove Park188819011911Empire ExhibitionBellahouston Park[29][29]The 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After World War I, the city suffered from the impact of the Post\u2013World War I recession and from the later Great Depression, this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the \"Red Clydeside\" movement. The city had recovered by the outbreak of World War II. The city saw aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe[30] during the Clydebank Blitz, during the war, then grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950s. By the 1960s, growth of industry in countries like Japan and West Germany, weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries. As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, urban decay, population decline, welfare dependency and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial Bruce Report, which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city. The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts that started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s. This involved the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.[31]\nWorld War IPost\u2013World War I recessionGreat DepressionRed ClydesideWorld War IIaerial bombardmentLuftwaffe[30][30]Clydebank BlitzWest Germanywelfare dependencyBruce ReportBruce Report[31][31] Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943) Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943)Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943)Sauchiehall StreetWorld War IIThe city invested heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and East Kilbride, dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands to halve the city's population base.[31] By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The \"Glasgow's miles better\" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment.[32] The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, its status as European Capital of Culture in 1990,[33] and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy.[34] However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler.[35] Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas, including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration, has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of gentrification.[36] In 2008, the city was listed by Lonely Planet as one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.[37]\nScottish OfficeSilicon Glennew townsEast KilbrideScottish Lowlands[31][31]Glasgow's miles betterBurrell CollectionScottish Exhibition and Conference Centre[32][32]Glasgow Garden FestivalEuropean Capital of Culture[33][33][34][34][35][35]regenerationClyde Waterfront Regenerationgentrification[36][36]Lonely Planet[37][37]Despite Glasgow's economic renaissance, the East End of the city remains the focus of social deprivation.[38] A Glasgow Economic Audit report published in 2007 stated that the gap between prosperous and deprived areas of the city is widening.[39] In 2006, 47% of Glasgow's population lived in the most deprived 15% of areas in Scotland,[39] while the Centre for Social Justice reported 29.4% of the city's working-age residents to be \"economically inactive\".[38] Although marginally behind the UK average, Glasgow still has a higher employment rate than Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.[39] In 2008 the city was ranked at 43 for Personal Safety in the Mercer index of top 50 safest cities in the world.[40] The Mercer report was specifically looking at Quality of Living, yet by 2011 within Glasgow, certain areas were (still) \"failing to meet the Scottish Air Quality Objective levels for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10)\".[41]\nEast End[38][38][39][39][39][39]Centre for Social Justice[38][38][39][39]Mercer[40][40][41][41]Sanitation[edit]Sanitation[edit][edit]With the population growing, the first scheme to provide a public water supply was by the Glasgow Company in 1806. A second company was formed in 1812, and the two merged in 1838, but there was some dissatisfaction with the quality of the water supplied.[42] The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company began supplying water to residents living to the south of the River Clyde in 1846, obtained from reservoirs, which gave 75,000 people a constant water supply,[42] but others were not so fortunate, and some 4,000 died in an outbreak of cholera in 1848/1849.[43] This led to the development of the Glasgow Corporation Water Works, with a project to raise the level of Loch Katrine and to convey clean water by gravity along a 26\u00a0mi (42\u00a0km) aqueduct to a holding reservoir at Milngavie, and then by pipes into the city.[44] The project cost \u00a3980,000[43] and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859.[45]\n[42][42][42][42]cholera[43][43]Glasgow Corporation Water WorksLoch Katrine[44][44][43][43]Queen Victoria[45][45]The engineer for the project was John Frederick Bateman, while James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project, and subsequently became Engineer in Chief for Glasgow Water Commissioners. He oversaw several improvements during his tenure, including a second aqueduct and further raising of water levels in Loch Katrine.[46] Additional supplies were provided by Loch Arklet in 1902, by impounding the water and creating a tunnel to allow water to flow into Loch Katrine. A similar scheme to create a reservoir in Glen Finglas was authorised in 1903, but was deferred, and was not completed until 1965.[43] Following the 2002 Glasgow floods, the waterborne parasite cryptosporidium was found in the reservoir at Milngavie, and so the new Milngavie water treatment works was built. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth in 2007, and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for \u00a310 million below its budgeted cost.[47]\nJohn Frederick Bateman[46][46]Glen Finglas[43][43]2002 Glasgow floodscryptosporidiumMilngavie water treatment worksQueen Elizabeth[47][47]Good health requires both clean water and effective removal of sewage. The Caledonian Railway rebuilt many of the sewers, as part of a deal to allow them to tunnel under the city, and sewage treatment works were opened at Dalmarnoch in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. The works experimented to find better ways to treat sewage, and a number of experimental filters were constructed, until a full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 at a cost of \u00a34 million.[48] Treated sludge was dumped at sea, and Glasgow Corporation owned six sludge ships between 1904 and 1998,[49] when the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive ended the practice.[50] The sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel 3.1\u00a0mi (5.0\u00a0km) long, which provides 20\u00d710^6\u00a0imp\u00a0gal (90\u00a0Ml) of storm water storage. It will reduce the risk of flooding and the likelihood that sewage will overflow into the Clyde during storms.[51] Since 2002, clean water provision and sewerage have been the responsibility of Scottish Water.[52]\nCaledonian Railway[48][48][49][49]Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive[50][50]\u00d71010^6[51][51]Scottish Water[52][52]Heraldry[edit]Heraldry[edit][edit]The coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866CrestSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.The coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866CrestSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.The coat of arms of the City of GlasgowThe coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866Adopted1866CrestSaint MungoCrestCrestSaint MungoSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsSupportersSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.MottoMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.The coat of arms of the City of Glasgow was granted to the royal burgh by the Lord Lyon on 25 October 1866.[53] It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date.

This was abbreviated to \"Let Glasgow Flourish\" and adopted as the city's motto.\nLord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy nameIn 1450, John Stewart, the first Lord Provost of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a \"St Mungo's Bell\" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the People's Palace Museum, near Glasgow Green.\nLord ProvostPeople's PalaceGlasgow GreenThe supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in \"the act of benediction\". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold mural crown between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.\nbenedictionmural crownThe arms were re-matriculated by the City of Glasgow District Council on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996.

The city council was controlled by the Labour Party for over thirty years, since the decline of the Progressives. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the single transferable vote rather than the first-past-the-post system, the dominance of the Labour Party within the city started to decline.

During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the Independent Labour Party. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the poll tax; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the Scottish Socialist Party, another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a Conservative MP since the 1982 Hillhead by-election, when the SDP took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the Progressives) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour Lord Provost.\nIndustrial actionRed ClydesideIndependent Labour Partypoll taxScottish Socialist PartyConservative1982 Hillhead by-electionSDP2012ProgressivesLord ProvostGlasgow is represented in both the House of Commons in London, and the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh.

All are located to the west of the city, in neighbouring Renfrewshire.\nOwing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Winter temperatures are usually higher than in most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to continental Western Europe. At Paisley, the annual precipitation averages 1,245\u00a0mm (49.0\u00a0in). Glasgow has been named as the rainiest city of the UK, having an average of 170 days of rain a year.[64][65]\nMoscowoceanicK\u00f6ppenCfbGulf StreamPaisley[64][64][65][65]Winters are cool and overcast, with a January mean of 5.0\u00a0\u00b0C (41.0\u00a0\u00b0F), though lows sometimes fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C (10\u00a0\u00b0F) in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.\nDuring the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F), and very rarely exceed 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.\nThe official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe. The warmest month on record in the data series is July 2006, with an average high of 22.7\u00a0\u00b0C (72.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and low of 13.7\u00a0\u00b0C (56.7\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] Even this extreme event only matched a normal summer on similar parallels in continental Europe, underlining the maritime influences. The coldest month on record since the data series began is December 2010, during a severe cold wave affecting the British Isles. Even then, the December high was above freezing at 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C (34.9\u00a0\u00b0F) with the low of \u22124.4\u00a0\u00b0C (24.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] This still ensured Glasgow's coldest month of 2010 remained milder than the isotherm of \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F) normally used to determine continental climate normals.\n[66][66]cold wave[66][66]Temperature extremes have ranged from

peaked at 1,089,000. Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the Gorbals and relocation to \"new towns\" such as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld led to population decline.

In the 1881 UK Census, 83% of the population was born in Scotland, 13% in Ireland, 3% in England and 1% elsewhere. By 1911, the city was no longer gaining population by migration. The demographic percentages in the 1951 UK census were: born in Scotland 93%, Ireland 3%, England 3% and elsewhere 1%.[20] In the early twentieth century, many Lithuanian refugees began to settle in Glasgow and at its height in the 1950s; there were around 10,000 in the Glasgow area.[76] Many Italian Scots also settled in Glasgow, originating from provinces like Frosinone in Lazio and Lucca in north-west Tuscany at this time, many originally working as \"Hokey Pokey\" men.[77]\nIrelandDonegalFermanaghTyroneLondonderry[20][20]Lithuanian[76][76]Italian ScotsFrosinoneLazioLuccaTuscanyHokey Pokey[77][77]\n\n\nHistorical population of Glasgow and city limits\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population and city limits\n\n\nYear[78]\n\nPopulation\n\nArea  (km2)\n\nDensity  (inhabitants/km2)\n\nArea changes\n\n\n1300\n1,500\n-[79]\n\u2013\nInitial\n\n\n1600\n7,000\n\u2013\n\u2013\nUnknown\n\n\n1791\n66,000\n7.16\n9,217\nAnderson to James Street/West Nile Street to Camlachie\n\n\n1831\n202,426\n8.83\n22,924\nNecropolis and Blythswood\n\n\n1846\n280,000\n23.44\n11,945\nBurghs of Anderston and Calton/Barony of Gorbals\n\n\n1872\n494,824\n24.42\n20,263\nDistricts of Keppochhill, Alexandra Parade and the new Glasgow University grounds\n\n\n1891\n658,073\n48.00\n13,709\nBurghs of Govanhill, Crosshill, Pollokshields, Maryhill and Hillhead.

This had started as a residential district of the wealthy city merchants involved in international trade and the textile industries in the 18th and early 19th centuries, with their warehouses nearby, including the Tobacco Lords from whom many of the streets take their name. With its mercantile wealth, and continuing growth even before the Industrial Revolution, the city expanded by creating the New Town around George Square, soon followed by the New Town of Blythswood on Blythswood Hill which includes Blythswood Square.[99] The original medieval centre around Glasgow Cross and the High Street was left behind.\nMerchant CityTobacco LordsIndustrial RevolutionGeorge SquareBlythswood HillBlythswood Square[99][99]Glasgow Cross, situated at the junction of High Street, leading up to Glasgow Cathedral, Gallowgate, Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its Mercat cross. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Steeple, all that remains of the original Glasgow Tolbooth, which was demolished in 1921. Moving northward up High Street towards Rottenrow and Townhead lies the 15th century Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand's Lordship. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.[100]\nHigh StreetGlasgow CathedralTrongateMercat crossGlasgow TolboothRottenrowTownheadGlasgow CathedralProvand's Lordship[100][100]From the 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre flats and warehouse conversions.

The area has supported a growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces.[103] The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a \"cultural quarter\" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and Glasgow City Council,[103] and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both.[104] The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the Tron Theatre, the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the City Halls.[105]\nTrongateMerchant City Festival[103][103]Glasgow City Council[103][103][104][104]Tron TheatreCity Halls[105][105]International Financial Services District[edit]International Financial Services District[edit][edit]Further information: International Financial Services DistrictInternational Financial Services District The International Financial Services District alongside the River Clyde The International Financial Services District alongside the River ClydeThe International Financial Services District alongside the River ClydeInternational Financial Services DistrictTo the western edge of the city centre, occupying the areas of Blythswood Hill and Anderston, lies Glasgow's financial district, known officially as the International Financial Services District (IFSD), although often irreverently nicknamed by the contemporary press as the \"square kilometre\" or \"Wall Street on Clyde\".[106] Since the late 1980s the construction of many modern office blocks and high rise developments have paved the way for the IFSD to become one of the UK's largest financial quarters.

Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by David Dale, whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern Gillespie, Kidd & Coia building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as \"Homes for the Future\", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.[113]\nGlasgow Necropoliscathedral[112][112]John KnoxDavid DaleNational Trust for ScotlandGillespie, Kidd & Coia[113][113]East of Glasgow Cross is St Andrew's in the Square, the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739\u20131757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy tobacco merchants.

The adjoining urban area includes some of Greater Glasgow's most affluent suburban towns, such as Newton Mearns, Clarkston, and Giffnock, all of which are in East Renfrewshire, as well as Thorntonhall in South Lanarkshire. Newlands and Dumbreck are examples of high-value residential districts within the city boundaries. There are many areas containing a high concentration of sandstone tenements, examples being Battlefield, Govanhill, Mount Florida and Shawlands. The large suburb of Pollokshields comprises both a quiet western part with undulating tree-lined boulevards lined with expensive villas, and a busier eastern part with a high-density grid of tenements and small shops. The south side also includes some post-war housing estates of various sizes such as Toryglen, Pollok, Castlemilk and Arden. The towns of Cambuslang and Rutherglen were included in the City of Glasgow district from 1975 to 1996, but are now in the South Lanarkshire council area.[119][120][121]\nNewton MearnsClarkstonGiffnockEast RenfrewshireThorntonhallSouth LanarkshireNewlandsDumbreckBattlefieldGovanhillMount FloridaShawlandsPollokshieldsToryglenPollokCastlemilkArdenCambuslangRutherglenSouth Lanarkshire[119][119][120][120][121][121]Although predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Scotland Street School Museum and House for an Art Lover; the Burrell Collection in Pollok Country Park; Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson's Holmwood House villa; the National Football Stadium Hampden Park in Mount Florida (home of Queens Park FC) and Ibrox Stadium (home of Rangers FC).\nCharles Rennie MackintoshScotland Street School MuseumHouse for an Art LoverBurrell CollectionPollok Country ParkAlexander \"Greek\" ThomsonHolmwood HouseHampden ParkMount FloridaQueens Park FCIbrox StadiumRangers FCThe former docklands site at Pacific Quay on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the Glasgow Science Centre and the headquarters of BBC Scotland and STV Group (owner of STV), in a new purpose built digital media campus.\nPacific QuayGlasgow Science CentreBBC ScotlandSTV GroupSTVIn addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built, including the Clyde Arc known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at Pacific Quay and others at Tradeston and Springfield Quay.\nClyde ArcPacific QuayTradestonThe South Side also includes many public parks, including Linn Park, Queen's Park, and Bellahouston Park and several golf clubs, including the championship course at Haggs Castle.

It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is home to one of two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system.

Also in the 15th century began the building of Cathcart Castle, completed c. 1450 with an impressive view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle Mary Queen of Scots supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the Battle of Langside in May 1568. The castle was demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the central city area as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of Victorian architecture: the Glasgow City Chambers; the main building of the University of Glasgow, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott; and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, designed by Sir John W. Simpson, are notable examples.\nmedievalProvand's LordshipSt. Mungo's CathedralCathcart CastleMary Queen of ScotsBattle of LangsideVictorian architectureGlasgow City ChambersUniversity of GlasgowSir George Gilbert ScottKelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumSir John W.

A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the Queen's Cross Church, the only church by the renowned artist to be built.[160]\nGlasgow SchoolCharles Rennie MackintoshArts and Crafts MovementArt NouveauGlasgow School of ArtWillow TearoomsScotland Street School MuseumQueen's Cross Church[160][160]Another architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance is Alexander Thomson, with notable examples including the Holmwood House villa, and likewise Sir John James Burnet, awarded the R.I.B.A.'s Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the \"Second City of the Empire\". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The shipyards, marine engineering, steel making, and heavy industry all contributed to the growth of the city.\nAlexander ThomsonHolmwood HouseJohn James Burnetshipyardsmarine engineeringheavy industryMany of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond sandstone, but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the furnaces, until the Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956. In recent years many of these buildings have been cleaned and restored to their original appearance.[citation needed] There are over 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over 1,471 hectares (3,630 acres). Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields \u2013 the first major planned garden suburb in Britain \u2013 Newlands and the village of Carmunnock.[161]\nsandstonefurnacesClean Air Act[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation needed[161][161]Modern buildings in Glasgow include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and along the banks of the Clyde are the Glasgow Science Centre, The OVO Hydro and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, whose Clyde Auditorium was designed by Sir Norman Foster, and is colloquially known as the \"Armadillo\". In 2006 Zaha Hadid won a competition to design the new Museum of Transport.[162] Hadid's museum opened on the waterfront in 2011 and has been renamed the Riverside Museum to reflect the change in location and to celebrate Glasgow's rich industrial heritage stemming from the Clyde.[163]\nGlasgow Royal Concert HallGlasgow Science CentreThe OVO HydroScottish Exhibition and Conference CentreClyde AuditoriumSir Norman FosterArmadilloZaha HadidMuseum of Transport[162][162]Riverside Museum[163][163]Glasgow's impressive historical and modern architectural traditions were celebrated in 1999 when the city was designated UK City of Architecture and Design,[164] winning the accolade over Liverpool and Edinburgh.[165]\n[164][164]LiverpoolEdinburgh[165][165]Economy[edit]Economy[edit][edit] RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, better known as the QE2, was built in Glasgow at the John Brown Shipyard on the River Clyde.

Glasgow also has the third highest GDP Per capita of any city in the UK (after London and Edinburgh).[14][needs update] The city itself sustains more than 410,000 jobs in over 12,000 companies. Over 153,000 jobs were created in the city between 2000 and 2005\u00a0\u2013 a growth rate of 32%.[166] Glasgow's annual economic growth rate of 4.4% is now second only to that of London.

Once dominant export orientated manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding and other heavy engineering have been gradually replaced in importance by more diversified forms of economic activity, although major manufacturing firms continue to be headquartered in the city, such as Aggreko, Weir Group, Clyde Blowers, Howden, Linn Products, Firebrand Games, William Grant & Sons, Whyte and Mackay, The Edrington Group, British Polar Engines and Albion Motors.[168]\neconomy in Scotland[13][13][14][14][needs update]needs updateneeds updateneeds update[166][166][167][167]Greater GlasgowAggrekoWeir GroupClyde BlowersHowdenLinn ProductsFirebrand GamesWilliam Grant & SonsWhyte and MackayThe Edrington GroupBritish Polar EnginesAlbion Motors[168][168]Glasgow was once one of the most significant cities in the UK for manufacturing, which generated a great deal of the city's wealth; the most prominent industry being shipbuilding based on the River Clyde.[169] Among the historic vessels constructed there were the famed tea clipper Cutty Sark, the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS\u00a0Hood, and the transatlantic luxury liners Aquitania, RMS\u00a0Queen Mary, RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth, and RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II. Although Glasgow owed much of its economic growth to the shipbuilding industry, which still continues today in the form of Ferguson Marine and BAE Systems Maritime - Naval Ships' two shipyards, the city has its roots in the tobacco trade and is noted to have \"risen from its medieval slumber\" from trade in tobacco, pioneered by figures such as John Glassford.[170] The city was also noted for its locomotive construction industry\u2014led by firms such as the North British Locomotive Company\u2014which grew during the 19th century before entering a decline in the 1960s.\n[169][169]Cutty SarkCutty SarkHMS\u00a0HoodHoodAquitaniaRMS\u00a0Queen MaryQueen MaryRMS\u00a0Queen ElizabethQueen ElizabethRMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth IIQueen Elizabeth IIFerguson MarineBAE Systems Maritime - Naval ShipsJohn Glassford[170][170]North British Locomotive Company A view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employers A view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employersA view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employersWhilst manufacturing has declined, Glasgow's economy has seen significant relative growth of tertiary sector industries such as financial and business services (centred around the International Financial Services District on the Broomielaw, once a stretch of riverside warehouses replaced by modern office blocks), communications, biosciences, creative industries, healthcare, higher education, retail and tourism.[171] Glasgow is now the second most popular foreign tourist destination in Scotland (fifth in the UK)[172] and offers Scotland's largest retail centre.\ntertiaryInternational Financial Services DistrictBroomielawbiosciences[171][171][172][172]Between 1998 and 2001, the city's financial services sector grew at a rate of 30%, making considerable gains on Edinburgh, which has historically been the centre of the Scottish financial sector.[173][174] Glasgow is now one of Europe's sixteen largest financial centres,[175] with a growing number of Blue chip financial sector companies establishing significant operations or headquarters in the city.[176]\n[173][173][174][174][175][175]Blue chip[176][176]The 1990s and first decade of the 21st century saw substantial growth in the number of call centres based in Glasgow. In 2007 roughly 20,000 people, a third of all call centre employees in Scotland, were employed by Glasgow call centres.[177] This growth and its high use of recruitment agencies to hire graduates as temporary workers has led to accusations of exploitative practices such as long hours, poor pay and lack of job security by the TUC and other union bodies.[178] In recent years some call centres have taken steps to rectify this criticism.[citation needed]\ncall centres[177][177]TUC[178][178][citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededThe city's main manufacturing industries include companies involved in; shipbuilding, engineering, construction, brewing and distilling, printing and publishing, chemicals and textiles as well as newer growth sectors such as optoelectronics, software development and biotechnology.[179] Glasgow forms the western part of the Silicon Glen high tech sector of Scotland with consumer electronics companies such as RHA Technologies headquartered.\noptoelectronicssoftware developmentbiotechnology[179][179]Silicon GlenRHA TechnologiesTransport[edit]Transport[edit][edit]See also: transport in Glasgowtransport in GlasgowPublic transport[edit]Public transport[edit][edit] Glasgow Central station is the northern terminus of the West Coast Main Line.

Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, high ceilings and original period features.[189] The Hyndland area of Glasgow became the first tenement conservation area in the UK[190] and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.\ntenementssandstone[188][188][189][189]Hyndland[190][190]Like many cities in the UK, Glasgow witnessed the construction of high-rise housing in tower blocks in the 1960s, along with large overspill estates on the periphery of the city, in areas like Pollok, Nitshill, Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Milton and Drumchapel.[191] These were built to replace the decaying inner-city tenement buildings originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, to feed the local demand for labour.[192] The massive demand at that time outstripped the pace of new building, and many originally fine tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary.[193] Many degenerated into infamous slums, such as the Gorbals.\ntower blocksoverspill estatesPollokNitshillCastlemilkEasterhouseMiltonDrumchapel[191][191][192][192][193][193]slums 20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough Road 20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough Road20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough RoadEfforts to improve this housing situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust in the late 19th century, cleared the slums of the old town areas such as the Trongate, High Street and Glasgow Cross.[194] Subsequent urban renewal initiatives, such as those motivated by the Bruce Report, entailed the comprehensive demolition of slum tenement areas, the development of new towns on the periphery of the city, and the construction of tower blocks.\nTrongateHigh StreetGlasgow Cross[194][194]urban renewalBruce Reportnew townsThe policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful.[195] Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s[195] and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed many fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.[189] The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396\u00a0million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.[196]\n[195][195][195][195][189][189]Glasgow Housing Association[196][196]Healthcare[edit]Healthcare[edit][edit] Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the largest hospital campus in Europe.

Scotland and parts of Ulster in the north of Ireland (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots).[4] Most commonly spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, Northern Isles and northern Ulster, it is sometimes called Lowland Scots or Broad Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Goidelic Celtic language that was historically restricted to most of the Scottish Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the 16th century.[5] Modern Scots is a sister language of Modern English, as the two diverged independently from the same source: Early Middle English (1150\u20131300[6]).[7][8]\nScots is recognised as an indigenous language of Scotland,[9] a regional or minority language of Europe,[10] and a vulnerable language by UNESCO.[11][12] In the 2011 Scottish Census, over 1.5\u00a0million people in Scotland reported being able to speak Scots.[13]\nAs there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing a language from a dialect, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots, particularly its relationship to English.[14] Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects exist, they often render contradictory results. Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other.[15] Scots is sometimes regarded as a variety of English, though it has its own distinct dialects;[14]:\u200a894\u200a other scholars treat Scots as a distinct Germanic language, in the way that Norwegian is closely linked to but distinct from Danish.[14]:\u200a894\u200a\n\nContents\n\n1 Nomenclature\n\n1.1 Etymology\n\n\n2 History\n\n2.1 Language shift\n2.2 Decline in status\n\n\n3 Language revitalisation\n\n3.1 Education\n3.2 Government\n3.3 Media\n\n\n4 Geographic distribution\n5 Literature\n6 Phonology\n\n6.1 Vowels\n6.2 Consonants\n\n\n7 Orthography\n8 Grammar\n9 Sample text of Modern Scots\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\n\n12.1 Dictionaries and linguistic information\n12.2 Collections of texts\n\n\n\n\nNomenclature[edit]\nNative speakers sometimes refer to their vernacular as braid Scots (or \"broad Scots\" in English)[16] or use a dialect name such as the \"Doric\"[17] or the \"Buchan Claik\".[18] The old-fashioned Scotch, an English loan,[14]:\u200a892\u200a occurs occasionally, especially in Ulster.[19][20] The term Lallans, a variant of the Modern Scots word lawlands [\u02c8lo\u031c\u02d0l\u0259n(d)z, \u02c8l\u0251\u02d0l\u0259nz],[21] is also used, though this is more often taken to mean the Lallans literary form.[22] Scots in Ireland is known in official circles as Ulster-Scots (Ulst\u00e8r-Scotch in revivalist Ulster-Scots) or \"Ullans\", a recent neologism merging Ulster and Lallans.[23]\n\nEtymology[edit]\nScots is a contraction of Scottis, the Older Scots[16] and northern version of late Old English: Scottisc (modern English \"Scottish\"), which replaced the earlier i-mutated version Scyttisc.[24] Before the end of the fifteenth century, English speech in Scotland was known as \"English\" (written Ynglis or Inglis at the time), whereas \"Scottish\" (Scottis) referred to Gaelic.[25] By the beginning of the fifteenth century, the English language used in Scotland had arguably become a distinct language, albeit one lacking a name which clearly distinguished it from all the other English variants and dialects spoken in Britain. From 1495, the term Scottis was increasingly used to refer to the Lowland vernacular[14]:\u200a894\u200a and Erse, meaning \"Irish\", was used as a name for Gaelic. For example, towards the end of the fifteenth century, William Dunbar was using Erse to refer to Gaelic and, in the early sixteenth century, Gavin Douglas was using Scottis as a name for the Lowland vernacular.[26][27] The Gaelic of Scotland is now usually called Scottish Gaelic.\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of the Scots language\n The growth and distribution of Scots in Scotland and Ulster[28][29] \u00a0\u00a0Old English by the beginning of the 9th century in the northern portion of the Anglo-Saxon[30] kingdom of Northumbria, now part of Scotland \u00a0\u00a0Early Scots by the beginning of the 15th century \u00a0\u00a0Modern Scots by the mid 20th century\nNorthumbrian Old English had been established in what is now southeastern Scotland as far as the River Forth by the seventh century, as the region was part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria.[31] Middle Irish was the language of the Scottish court, and the common use of Old English remained largely confined to this area until the thirteenth century. The succeeding variety of early northern Middle English spoken in southeastern Scotland is also known as Early Scots. It began to further diverge from the Middle English of Northumbria due to twelfth and thirteenth century immigration of Scandinavian-influenced Middle English-speakers from the North and Midlands of England.[31]:\u200axliii\u200a Later influences on the development of Scots came from the Romance languages via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman French,[31]:\u200alxiii\u2013lxv\u200a and later Parisian French, due to the Auld Alliance. Additionally, there were Dutch and Middle Low German influences due to trade with and immigration from the Low Countries.[31]:\u200alxiii\u200a Scots also includes loan words in the legal and administrative fields resulting from contact with Middle Irish, and reflected in early medieval legal documents.[31]:\u200alxi\u200a Contemporary Scottish Gaelic loans are mainly for geographical and cultural features, such as c\u00e8ilidh, loch and clan. Cumbric and Pictish, the medieval Brittonic languages of Northern England and Scotland, are the suspected source of a small number of Scots words, such as lum (derived from Cumbric) meaning \"chimney\".[32] From the thirteenth century, the Early Scots language spread further into Scotland via the burghs, which were proto-urban institutions first established by King David I. In fourteenth century Scotland, the growth in prestige of Early Scots and the complementary decline of French made Scots the prestige dialect of most of eastern Scotland. By the sixteenth century, Middle Scots had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.[33]\nFrom 1610 to the 1690s during the Plantation of Ulster, some 200,000 Scots-speaking Lowlanders settled as colonists in Ulster in Ireland.[34][full citation needed] In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.[35][full citation needed]\nThe name Modern Scots is used to describe the Scots language after 1700.[citation needed]\nScots was studied alongside English and Scots Gaelic in the Linguistic Survey of Scotland at the University of Edinburgh, which began in 1949 and began to publish results in the 1970s.[36]  Also beginning in the 1970s, the Atlas Linguarum Europae studied the Scots language used at 15 sites in Scotland, each with their own dialect.[37]\n\nLanguage shift[edit]\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.[33]:\u200a10\u200a When William Flower, an English herald, spoke to Mary of Guise and her councillors in 1560, they first used the \"Scottyshe toung\". When he was \"not well understanding\", they switched into her native French.[38] King James VI, who in 1603 became James I of England, observed in his work Some Reulis and Cautelis to Be Observit and Eschewit in Scottis Poesie that \"For albeit sindrie hes written of it in English, quhilk is lykest to our language...\" (For though several have written of (the subject) in English, which is the language most similar to ours...). However, with the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.[33]:\u200a11\u200a In his first speech to the English Parliament in March 1603, King James VI and I declared, \"Hath not God first united these two Kingdomes both in Language, Religion, and similitude of maners?\".[39] Following James VI's move to London, the Protestant Church of Scotland adopted the 1611 Authorized King James Version of the Bible; subsequently, the Acts of Union 1707 led to Scotland joining England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, having a single Parliament of Great Britain based in London. After the Union and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of \"Scottishness\" itself.[40] Many leading Scots of the period, such as David Hume, defined themselves as Northern British rather than Scottish.[40]:\u200a2\u200a They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed union. Nevertheless, Scots was still spoken across a wide range of domains until the end of the eighteenth century.[33]:\u200a11\u200a Frederick Pottle, the twentieth-century biographer of James Boswell (1740\u20131795), described James's view of the use of Scots by his father Alexander Boswell (1706\u20131782)[when?] in the eighteenth century while serving as a judge of the Supreme Courts of Scotland:\n\nHe scorned modern literature, spoke broad Scots from the bench, and even in writing took no pains to avoid the Scotticisms which most of his colleagues were coming to regard as vulgar.\nHowever, others did scorn Scots, such as Scottish Enlightenment intellectuals David Hume and Adam Smith, who went to great lengths to get rid of every Scotticism from their writings.[41] Following such examples, many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about \u00a3200 in today's money[42]), they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland. These eighteenth-century activities would lead to the creation of Scottish Standard English.[33]:\u200a13\u200a Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.[33]:\u200a14\u200a\n\n Statue of Robert Burns in Canberra, Australia\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the use of Scots as a literary language was revived by several prominent Scotsmen[citation needed] such as Robert Burns. Such writers established a new cross-dialect literary norm.\nScots terms were included in the English Dialect Dictionary, edited by Joseph Wright. Wright had great difficulty in recruiting volunteers from Scotland, as many refused to cooperate with a venture that regarded Scots as a dialect of English, and he obtained enough help only through the assistance from a Professor Shearer in Scotland.[43] Wright himself rejected the argument that Scots was a separate language, saying that this was a \"quite modern mistake\".[43]\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, knowledge of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary norms waned, and as of 2006[update],  there is no institutionalised standard literary form.[44] By the 1940s, the Scottish Education Department's language policy was that Scots had no value: \"it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture\".[45] Students reverted to Scots outside the classroom, but the reversion was not complete. What occurred, and has been occurring ever since, is a process of language attrition, whereby successive generations have adopted more and more features from Standard English. This process has accelerated rapidly since widespread access to mass media in English and increased population mobility became available after the Second World War.[33]:\u200a15\u200a It has recently taken on the nature of wholesale language shift, sometimes also termed language change, convergence or merger. By the end of the twentieth century, Scots was at an advanced stage of language death over much of Lowland Scotland.[46] Residual features of Scots are often regarded as slang.[47] A 2010 Scottish Government study of \"public attitudes towards the Scots language\" found that 64% of respondents (around 1,000 individuals in a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) \"don't really think of Scots as a language\", also finding \"the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%)\".[48]\n\nDecline in status[edit]\n Lufe God abufe al and yi nychtbour as yi self (\"Love God above all and thy neighbour as thyself\"), an example of Early Scots, on John Knox House, Edinburgh\nBefore the Treaty of Union 1707, when Scotland and England joined to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, there is ample evidence that Scots was widely held to be an independent sister language[49] forming a pluricentric diasystem with English.\nGerman linguist Heinz Kloss considered Modern Scots a Halbsprache ('half language') in terms of an abstand and ausbau languages framework,[50] although today in Scotland most people's speech is somewhere on a continuum ranging from traditional broad Scots to Scottish Standard English. Many speakers are diglossic and may be able to code-switch along the continuum depending on the situation. Where on this continuum English-influenced Scots becomes Scots-influenced English is difficult to determine. Because standard English now generally has the role of a Dachsprache ('roofing language'), disputes often arise as to whether the varieties of Scots are dialects of Scottish English or constitute a separate language in their own right.[51][52]\nThe UK government now accepts Scots as a regional language and has recognised it as such under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[53]\n\nNotwithstanding the UK government's and the Scottish Executive's obligations under part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Scottish Executive recognises and respects Scots (in all its forms) as a distinct language, and does not consider the use of Scots to be an indication of poor competence in English.\nEvidence for its existence as a separate language lies in the extensive body of Scots literature, its independent \u2013 if somewhat fluid \u2013 orthographic conventions, and in its former use as the language of the original Parliament of Scotland.[54] Because Scotland retained distinct political, legal, and religious systems after the Union, many Scots terms passed into Scottish English.\n\nLanguage revitalisation[edit]\n William Wye Smith's The New Testament in Braid Scots\nDuring the 2010s, increased interest was expressed in the language.\n\nEducation[edit]\nThe status of the language was raised in Scottish schools,[55] with Scots being included in the new national school curriculum.[56] Previously in Scotland's schools there had been little education taking place through the medium of Scots, although it may have been covered superficially in English lessons, which could entail reading some Scots literature and observing the local dialect. Much of the material used was often Standard English disguised as Scots, which caused upset among proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots alike.[57] One example of the educational establishment's approach to Scots is, \"Write a poem in Scots. (It is important not to be worried about spelling in this \u2013 write as you hear the sounds in your head.)\",[58] whereas guidelines for English require teaching pupils to be \"writing fluently and legibly with accurate spelling and punctuation\".[59]\nA course in Scots language and culture delivered through the medium of Standard English and produced by the Open University (OU) in Scotland, the Open University's School of Languages and Applied Linguistics as well as Education Scotland became available online for the first time in December 2019.[60]\n\nGovernment[edit]\nIn the 2011 Scottish census, a question on Scots language ability was featured[9] and is planned to be included again in the 2022 census.[61]\nThe Scottish government set its first Scots Language Policy in 2015, in which it pledged to support its preservation and encourage respect, recognition and use of Scots.[9] The Scottish Parliament website also offers some information on the language in Scots.[62]\n\nMedia[edit]\nSerious use of the language for news, encyclopaedias, documentaries, etc., remains rare and usually reserved for niches where it is deemed acceptable, e.g. comedy, Burns Night, or representations of traditions and times gone by. However, since 2016 The National newspaper has regularly published some news articles in the language.[63] The 2010s also saw an increasing number of English books translated in Scots and becoming widely available, particularly those in popular children's fiction series such as The Gruffalo, Harry Potter and several by Roald Dahl[64] and David Walliams.[65] In 2021, the music streaming service Spotify created a Scots language listing.[66]\n\nGeographic distribution[edit]\nIn Scotland, Scots is spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, the Northern Isles, Caithness, Arran and Campbeltown. In Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, its area is usually defined through the works of Robert John Gregg to include the counties of Down, Antrim, Londonderry and Donegal (especially in East Donegal and Inishowen).[67] More recently, the Fintona-born linguist Warren Maguire has argued that some of the criteria that Gregg used as distinctive of Ulster Scots are common in south-west Tyrone and were found in other sites across Northern Ireland investigated by the Linguistic Survey of Scotland.[68] Dialects of Scots include Insular Scots, Northern Scots, Central Scots, Southern Scots and Ulster Scots.\nIt has been difficult to determine the number of speakers of Scots via census, because many respondents might interpret the question \"Do you speak Scots?\" in different ways. Campaigners for Scots pressed for this question to be included in the 2001 UK National Census. The results from a 1996 trial before the Census, by the General Register Office for Scotland (GRO),[69] suggested that there were around 1.5\u00a0million speakers of Scots, with 30% of Scots responding \"Yes\" to the question \"Can you speak the Scots language?\", but only 17% responding \"Aye\" to the question \"Can you speak Scots?\".[citation needed] It was also found that older, working-class people were more likely to answer in the affirmative. The University of Aberdeen Scots Leid Quorum performed its own research in 1995, cautiously suggesting that there were 2.7\u00a0million speakers, though with clarification as to why these figures required context.[70]\nThe GRO questions, as freely acknowledged by those who set them, were not as detailed and systematic as the University of Aberdeen ones, and only included reared speakers (people raised speaking Scots), not those who had learned the language. Part of the difference resulted from the central question posed by surveys: \"Do you speak Scots?\". In the Aberdeen University study, the question was augmented with the further clause \"...\u00a0or a dialect of Scots such as Border etc.\", which resulted in greater recognition from respondents. The GRO concluded that there simply was not enough linguistic self-awareness amongst the Scottish populace, with people still thinking of themselves as speaking badly pronounced, grammatically inferior English rather than Scots, for an accurate census to be taken. The GRO research concluded that \"[a] more precise estimate of genuine Scots language ability would require a more in-depth interview survey and may involve asking various questions about the language used in different situations. Such an approach would be inappropriate for a Census.\" Thus, although it was acknowledged that the \"inclusion of such a Census question would undoubtedly raise the profile of Scots\", no question about Scots was, in the end, included in the 2001 Census.[51][71][72] The Scottish Government's Pupils in Scotland Census 2008[73] found that 306 pupils[clarification needed] spoke Scots as their main home language. A Scottish Government study in 2010 found that 85% of around 1000 respondents (being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) claim to speak Scots to varying degrees.[48]\nThe 2011 UK census was the first to ask residents of Scotland about Scots. A campaign called Aye Can was set up to help individuals answer the question.[74][75] The specific wording used was \"Which of these can you do? Tick all that apply\" with options for \"Understand\", \"Speak\", \"Read\" and \"Write\" in three columns: English, Scottish Gaelic and Scots.[76] Of approximately 5.1\u00a0million respondents, about 1.2\u00a0million (24%) could speak, read and write Scots, 3.2\u00a0million (62%) had no skills in Scots and the remainder had some degree of skill, such as understanding Scots (0.27\u00a0million, 5.2%) or being able to speak it but not read or write it (0.18\u00a0million, 3.5%).[77] There were also small numbers of Scots speakers recorded in England and Wales on the 2011 Census, with the largest numbers being either in bordering areas (e.g. Carlisle) or in areas that had recruited large numbers of Scottish workers in the past (e.g. Corby or the former mining areas of Kent).[78]\n\nLiterature[edit]\nMain article: Scots-language literature\nAmong the earliest Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (fourteenth century), Wyntoun's Cronykil and Blind Harry's The Wallace (fifteenth century). From the fifteenth century, much literature based on the Royal Court in Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews was produced by writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Gavin Douglas and David Lyndsay. The Complaynt of Scotland was an early printed work in Scots. The Eneados is a Middle Scots translation of Virgil's Aeneid, completed by Gavin Douglas in 1513.\nAfter the seventeenth century, anglicisation increased. At the time, many of the oral ballads from the borders and the North East were written down. Writers of the period were Robert Sempill, Robert Sempill the younger, Francis Sempill, Lady Wardlaw and Lady Grizel Baillie.\nIn the eighteenth century, writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Burns, James Orr, Robert Fergusson and Walter Scott continued to use Scots \u2013 Burns's \"Auld Lang Syne\" is in Scots, for example. Scott introduced vernacular dialogue to his novels. Other well-known authors like Robert Louis Stevenson, William Alexander, George MacDonald, J. M. Barrie and other members of the Kailyard school like Ian Maclaren also wrote in Scots or used it in dialogue.\nIn the Victorian era popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular, often of unprecedented proportions.[79]\nIn the early twentieth century, a renaissance in the use of Scots occurred, its most vocal figure being Hugh MacDiarmid whose benchmark poem \"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\" (1926) did much to demonstrate the power of Scots as a modern idiom. Other contemporaries were Douglas Young, John Buchan, Sydney Goodsir Smith, Robert Garioch, Edith Anne Robertson and Robert McLellan. The revival extended to verse and other literature.\nIn 1955, three Ayrshire men \u2013 Sandy MacMillan, an English teacher at Ayr Academy; Thomas Limond, noted town chamberlain of Ayr; and A. L. \"Ross\" Taylor, rector of Cumnock Academy\u00a0\u2013 collaborated to write Bairnsangs (\"Child Songs\"),[80] a collection of children's nursery rhymes and poems in Scots. The book contains a five-page glossary of contemporary Scots words and their pronunciations.\nAlexander Gray's translations into Scots constitute the greater part of his work, and are the main basis for his reputation.\nIn 1983, William Laughton Lorimer's translation of the New Testament from the original Greek was published.\nScots is sometimes used in contemporary fiction, such as the Edinburgh dialect of Scots in Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh (later made into a motion picture of the same name).\nBut'n'Ben A-Go-Go by Matthew Fitt is a cyberpunk novel written entirely in what Wir Ain Leed[81] (\"Our Own Language\") calls \"General Scots\". Like all cyberpunk work, it contains imaginative neologisms.\nThe Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam has been translated into Scots by Rab Wilson (published in 2004). Alexander Hutchison has translated the poetry of Catullus into Scots, and in the 1980s, Liz Lochhead produced a Scots translation of Tartuffe by Moli\u00e8re. J. K. Annand translated poetry and fiction from German and Medieval Latin into Scots.\nThe strip cartoons Oor Wullie and The Broons in the Sunday Post use some Scots. In 2018, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stane, a Scots translation of the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published by Matthew Fitt.\nIn 2020, the Scots Wikipedia received a burst of attention after a Reddit post criticized it for containing a large number of articles written in very low-quality Scots by a single prolific contributor who was not a native speaker of Scots.[82][83]\n\nPhonology[edit]\nFurther information: Modern Scots \u00a7\u00a0Phonology, and Phonological history of Scots\n Scottish poet Christine De Luca speaking the Shetland dialect of Scots\nVowels[edit]\nThe vowel system of Modern Scots:[84]\n\n\n\nAitken\nIPA\nCommon spellings\n\n\n1\nshort /\u0259i/long /a\u026a/\ni-e, y-e, ey\n\n\n2\n/i/\nee, e-e, ie\n\n\n3\n/ei/[a]\nei, ea\n\n\n4\n/e/\na-e, #ae\n\n\n5\n/o/\noa, o-e\n\n\n6\n/u/\nou, oo, u-e\n\n\n7\n/\u00f8/[b][c]\nui, eu[c]\n\n\n8\n/e\u02d0/\nai, #ay\n\n\n8a\n/\u0259i/\ni-e, y-e, ey\n\n\n9\n/oe/\noi, oy\n\n\n10\n/\u0259i/\ni-e, y-e, ey\n\n\n11\n/i\u02d0/\n#ee, #ie\n\n\n12\n/\u0251\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0/\nau, #aw\n\n\n13\n/\u028cu/[d]\now, #owe\n\n\n14\n/ju/\new\n\n\n15\n/\u026a/\ni\n\n\n16\n/\u025b/\ne\n\n\n17\n/\u0251, a/\na\n\n\n18\n/\u0254/[e]\no\n\n\n19\n/\u028c/\nu\n\n\n\n^ With the exception of North Northern dialects[85] this vowel has generally merged with vowels 2, 4 or 8.\n\n^ Merges with vowels 15. and 8. in central dialects and vowel 2 in Northern dialects.\n\n^ a b Also /(j)u/ or /(j)\u028c/ before /k/ and /x/ depending on dialect.\n\n^ Monophthongisation to /o/ may occur before /k/.\n\n^ Some mergers with vowel 5.\n\n\nVowel length is usually conditioned by the Scottish vowel length rule.\n\nConsonants[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLabial\n\nDental\n\nAlveolar\n\nPost-alveolar\n\nPalatal\n\nVelar\n\nGlottal\n\n\nNasal\n\nm\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\u014b[a]\n\n\n\n\nStop\n\np b\n\n\n\nt d[b]\n\nt\u0283 d\u0292[c]\n\n\n\nk \u0261[d]\n\n\u0294\n\n\nFricative\n\nf v\n\n\u03b8 \u00f0[e]\n\ns z[f]\n\n\u0283 \u0292\n\n\u00e7[g]\n\nx[g]\n\nh\n\n\nApproximant\n\ncentral\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0279[h]\n\n\n\nj\n\n\u028d[i] w\n\n\n\n\nlateral\n\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrill\n\n\n\n\n\nr[h]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ Spelt ng, always /\u014b/.[86]\n\n^ /t/ may be a glottal stop between vowels or word final.[86]:\u200a501\u200a In Ulster dentalised pronunciations may also occur, also for /d/.\n\n^ The cluster nch is usually realised /n\u0283/[47]:\u200a500\u200a e.g. brainch (\"branch\"), dunch (\"push\"), etc.\n\n^ In Northern dialects, the clusters kn and gn may be realised as /kn/, /tn/ and /\u0261n/[47]:\u200a501\u200a e.g. knap (\"talk\"), knee, knowe (\"knoll\"), etc.\n\n^ Spelt th.

After the Acts of Union in 1707 the emerging Scottish form of Standard English replaced Scots for most formal writing in Scotland.[33]:\u200a11\u200a\nThe eighteenth-century Scots revival saw the introduction of a new literary language descended from the old court Scots, but with an orthography that had abandoned some of the more distinctive old Scots spellings[90] and adopted many standard English spellings. Despite the updated spelling, however, the rhymes make it clear that a Scots pronunciation was intended.[91] These writings also introduced what came to be known as the apologetic apostrophe,[91]:\u200axiv\u200a generally occurring where a consonant exists in the Standard English cognate. This Written Scots drew not only on the vernacular, but also on the King James Bible, and was heavily influenced by the norms and conventions of Augustan English poetry.[14]:\u200a168\u200a Consequently, this written Scots looked very similar to contemporary Standard English, suggesting a somewhat modified version of that, rather than a distinct speech form with a phonological system which had been developing independently for many centuries.[92] This modern literary dialect, \"Scots of the book\" or Standard Scots,[93][94] once again gave Scots an orthography of its own, lacking neither \"authority nor author\".[95] This literary language used throughout Lowland Scotland and Ulster,[96] embodied by writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Murray, David Herbison, James Orr, James Hogg and William Laidlaw among others, is well described in the 1921 Manual of Modern Scots.[97]\nOther authors developed dialect writing, preferring to represent their own speech in a more phonological manner rather than following the pan-dialect conventions of modern literary Scots,[91] especially for the northern[98] and insular dialects of Scots.\nDuring the twentieth century, a number of proposals for spelling reform were presented. Commenting on this, John Corbett (2003: 260) writes that \"devising a normative orthography for Scots has been one of the greatest linguistic hobbies of the past century\". Most proposals entailed regularising the use of established eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conventions, in particular the avoidance of the apologetic apostrophe, which represented letters that were perceived to be missing when compared to the corresponding English cognates but were never actually present in the Scots word.[99][100] For example, in the fourteenth century, Barbour spelt the Scots cognate of \"taken\" as tane. It is argued that, because there has been no k in the word for over 700 years, representing its omission with an apostrophe is of little value. The current spelling is usually taen.\nThrough the twentieth century, with the decline of spoken Scots and knowledge of the literary tradition, phonetic (often humorous) representations became more common.[citation needed]\n\nGrammar[edit]\nSee also: Modern Scots grammar\nModern Scots follows the subject\u2013verb\u2013object sentence structure like Standard English. However, the word order Gie's it (Give us it) vs. \"Give it to me\" may be preferred.[14]:\u200a897\u200a\nThe indefinite article a may be used before both consonants and vowels. The definite article the is used before the names of seasons, days of the week, many nouns, diseases, trades and occupations, sciences and academic subjects.[97]:\u200a78\u200a It is also often used in place of the indefinite article and instead of a possessive pronoun.[97]:\u200a77\u200a\nScots includes some strong plurals such as ee/een (\"eye/eyes\"), cauf/caur (\"calf/calves\"), horse/horse (\"horse/horses\"), cou/kye (\"cow/cows\") and shae/shuin (\"shoe/shoes\") that survived from Old English into Modern Scots, but have become weak plurals in Standard Modern English \u2013 ox/oxen and child/children being exceptions.[97]:\u200a79\u200a[14]:\u200a896\u200a Nouns of measure and quantity remain unchanged in the plural.[14]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a80\u200a\nThe relative pronoun is that for all persons and numbers, but may be elided.[14]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a102\u200a Modern Scots also has a third adjective/adverb this-that-yon/yonder (thon/thonder) indicating something at some distance.[14]:\u200a896\u200a Thir and thae are the plurals of this and that respectively.\nThe present tense of verbs adheres to the Northern subject rule whereby verbs end in -s in all persons and numbers except when a single personal pronoun is next to the verb.[14]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a112\u200a Certain verbs are often used progressively[14]:\u200a896\u200a and verbs of motion may be dropped before an adverb or adverbial phrase of motion.[14]:\u200a897\u200a\nMany verbs have strong or irregular forms which are distinctive from Standard English.[14]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a126\u200a\nThe regular past form of the weak or regular verbs is -it, -t or -ed, according to the preceding consonant or vowel.[14]:\u200a896\u200a[97]:\u200a113\u200a\nThe present participle and gerund in are now usually /\u0259n/[101] but may still be differentiated /\u0259n/ and /in/ in Southern Scots,[102] and /\u0259n/ and /\u026an/ in Northern Scots.\nThe negative particle is na, sometimes spelled nae, e.g. canna (\"can't\"), daurna (\"daren't\"), michtna (\"mightn't\").[97]:\u200a115\u200a\nAdverbs usually take the same form as the verb root or adjective, especially after verbs. Examples include Haein a real guid day (\"Having a really good day\") and She's awfu fauchelt (\"She's awfully tired\").\n\nSample text of Modern Scots[edit]\nFrom The Four Gospels in Braid Scots (William Wye Smith):\n\n\nNoo the nativitie o' Jesus Christ was this gate: whan his mither Mary was mairry't till Joseph, 'or they cam thegither, she was fund wi' bairn o' the Holie Spirit.\nThan her guidman, Joseph, bein an upricht man, and no desirin her name sud be i' the mooth o' the public, was ettlin to pit her awa' hidlins.\nBut as he had thir things in his mind, see! an Angel o' the Lord appear't to him by a dream, sayin, \"Joseph, son o' Dauvid, binna feared to tak till ye yere wife, Mary; for that whilk is begotten in her is by the Holie Spirit.\n\"And she sall bring forth a son, and ye sal ca' his name Jesus\u00a0; for he sal save his folk frae their sins.\"\nNoo, a' this was dune, that it micht come to pass what was said by the Lord throwe the prophet,\n\"Tak tent! a maiden sal be wi' bairn, and sal bring forth a son; and they wull ca' his name Emmanuel,\" whilk is translatit, \"God wi' us.\"\nSae Joseph, comin oot o' his sleep, did as the Angel had bidden him, and took till him his wife.\nAnd leev'd in continence wi' her till she had brocht forth her firstborn son; and ca'd his name Jesus.\n\n\u2014\u2009Matthew 1:18\u201321\nFrom The New Testament in Scots (William Laughton Lorimer, 1885\u20131967)\n\n\nThis is the storie o the birth o Jesus Christ. His mither Mary wis trystit til Joseph, but afore they war mairriet she wis fund tae be wi bairn bi the Halie Sp\u00edrit. Her husband Joseph, honest man, hed nae mind tae affront her afore the warld an wis for brakkin aff their tryst hidlinweys; an sae he wis een ettlin tae dae, whan an angel o the Lord kythed til him in a draim an said til him, \"Joseph, son o Dauvit, be nane feared tae tak Mary your trystit wife intil your hame; the bairn she is cairrein is o the Halie Sp\u00edrit. She will beir a son, an the name ye ar tae g\u00ede him is Jesus, for he will sauf his fowk frae their sins.\"Aa this happent at the wurd spokken bi the Lord throu the Prophet micht be fulfilled: Behaud, the virgin wil bouk an beir a son, an they will caa his name Immanuel \u2013 that is, \"God wi us\".Whan he hed waukit frae his sleep, Joseph did as the angel hed bidden him, an tuik his trystit wife hame wi him.

language variety in the West Germanic language family, spoken in Scotland and parts of Ulster in the north of Ireland (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots).[4] Most commonly spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, Northern Isles and northern Ulster, it is sometimes called Lowland Scots or Broad Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Goidelic Celtic language that was historically restricted to most of the Scottish Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the 16th century.[5] Modern Scots is a sister language of Modern English, as the two diverged independently from the same source: Early Middle English (1150\u20131300[6]).[7][8]\nScotsendonymScotsScottish GaelicAlbaisBeurla GhalltaAngliclanguage varietyWest Germanic language familyScotlandUlsterIrelanddialectUlster

English[6][6][7][7][8][8]Scots is recognised as an indigenous language of Scotland,[9] a regional or minority language of Europe,[10] and a vulnerable language by UNESCO.[11][12] In the 2011 Scottish Census, over 1.5\u00a0million people in Scotland reported being able to speak Scots.[13]\nScotland[9][9][10][10]UNESCO[11][11][12][12]2011 Scottish Census[13][13]As there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing a language from a dialect, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots, particularly its relationship to English.[14] Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects exist, they often render contradictory results. Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other.[15] Scots is sometimes regarded as a variety of English, though it has its own distinct dialects;[14]:\u200a894\u200a other scholars treat Scots as a distinct Germanic language, in the way that Norwegian is closely linked to but distinct from Danish.[14]:\u200a894\u200a\ncriteria for distinguishingdialectEnglish[14][14]linguistic continuumScottish Standard English[15][15][14][14]:\u200a894\u200a:\u200a894\u200aNorwegianDanish[14][14]:\u200a894\u200a:\u200a894\u200aContents\n\n1 Nomenclature\n\n1.1 Etymology\n\n\n2 History\n\n2.1 Language shift\n2.2 Decline in status\n\n\n3 Language revitalisation\n\n3.1 Education\n3.2 Government\n3.3 Media\n\n\n4 Geographic distribution\n5 Literature\n6 Phonology\n\n6.1 Vowels\n6.2 Consonants\n\n\n7 Orthography\n8 Grammar\n9 Sample text of Modern Scots\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\n\n12.1 Dictionaries and linguistic information\n12.2 Collections of texts\n\n\n\nContentsContents\n1 Nomenclature\n\n1.1 Etymology\n\n\n2 History\n\n2.1 Language shift\n2.2 Decline in status\n\n\n3 Language revitalisation\n\n3.1 Education\n3.2 Government\n3.3 Media\n\n\n4 Geographic distribution\n5 Literature\n6 Phonology\n\n6.1 Vowels\n6.2 Consonants\n\n\n7 Orthography\n8 Grammar\n9 Sample text of Modern Scots\n10 See also\n11 References\n12 External links\n\n12.1 Dictionaries and linguistic information\n12.2 Collections of texts\n\n\n1 Nomenclature\n\n1.1 Etymology\n\n1 Nomenclature1Nomenclature\n1.1 Etymology\n1.1 Etymology1.1 Etymology1.1Etymology2 History\n\n2.1 Language shift\n2.2 Decline in status\n\n2 History2History\n2.1 Language shift\n2.2 Decline in status\n2.1 Language shift2.1 Language shift2.1Language shift2.2 Decline in status2.2 Decline in status2.2Decline in status3 Language revitalisation\n\n3.1 Education\n3.2 Government\n3.3 Media\n\n3 Language revitalisation3Language revitalisation\n3.1 Education\n3.2 Government\n3.3 Media\n3.1 Education3.1 Education3.1Education3.2 Government3.2 Government3.2Government3.3 Media3.3 Media3.3Media4 Geographic distribution4 Geographic distribution4Geographic distribution5 Literature5 Literature5Literature6 Phonology\n\n6.1 Vowels\n6.2 Consonants\n\n6 Phonology6Phonology\n6.1 Vowels\n6.2 Consonants\n6.1 Vowels6.1 Vowels6.1Vowels6.2 Consonants6.2 Consonants6.2Consonants7 Orthography7 Orthography7Orthography8 Grammar8 Grammar8Grammar9 Sample text of Modern Scots9 Sample text of Modern Scots9Sample text of Modern Scots10 See also10 See also10See also11 References11 References11References12 External links\n\n12.1 Dictionaries and linguistic information\n12.2 Collections of texts\n\n12 External links12External links\n12.1 Dictionaries and linguistic information\n12.2 Collections of texts\n12.1 Dictionaries and linguistic information12.1 Dictionaries and linguistic information12.1Dictionaries and linguistic information12.2 Collections of texts12.2 Collections of texts12.2Collections of textsNomenclature[edit]Nomenclature[edit][edit]Native speakers sometimes refer to their vernacular as braid Scots (or \"broad Scots\" in English)[16] or use a dialect name such as the \"Doric\"[17] or the \"Buchan Claik\".[18] The old-fashioned Scotch, an English loan,[14]:\u200a892\u200a occurs occasionally, especially in Ulster.[19][20] The term Lallans, a variant of the Modern Scots word lawlands [\u02c8lo\u031c\u02d0l\u0259n(d)z, \u02c8l\u0251\u02d0l\u0259nz],[21] is also used, though this is more often taken to mean the Lallans literary form.[22] Scots in Ireland is known in official circles as Ulster-Scots (Ulst\u00e8r-Scotch in revivalist Ulster-Scots) or \"Ullans\", a recent neologism merging Ulster and Lallans.[23]\nvernacularbraid Scotsbraid Scots[16][16]Doric[17][17]Buchan ClaikBuchan Claik[18][18]ScotchScotch[14][14]:\u200a892\u200a:\u200a892\u200a[19][19][20][20]LallansLallansModern Scotslawlandslawlands[\u02c8lo\u031c\u02d0l\u0259n(d)z, \u02c8l\u0251\u02d0l\u0259nz][\u02c8lo\u031c\u02d0l\u0259n(d)z, \u02c8l\u0251\u02d0l\u0259nz][21][21]Lallansliterary form[22][22]Ulster-ScotsUlst\u00e8r-ScotchUlst\u00e8r-Scotchneologism[23][23]Etymology[edit]Etymology[edit][edit]Scots is a contraction of Scottis, the Older Scots[16] and northern version of late Old English: Scottisc (modern English \"Scottish\"), which replaced the earlier i-mutated version Scyttisc.[24] Before the end of the fifteenth century, English speech in Scotland was known as \"English\" (written Ynglis or Inglis at the time), whereas \"Scottish\" (Scottis) referred to Gaelic.[25] By the beginning of the fifteenth century, the English language used in Scotland had arguably become a distinct language, albeit one lacking a name which clearly distinguished it from all the other English variants and dialects spoken in Britain. From 1495, the term Scottis was increasingly used to refer to the Lowland vernacular[14]:\u200a894\u200a and Erse, meaning \"Irish\", was used as a name for Gaelic. For example, towards the end of the fifteenth century, William Dunbar was using Erse to refer to Gaelic and, in the early sixteenth century, Gavin Douglas was using Scottis as a name for the Lowland vernacular.[26][27] The Gaelic of Scotland is now usually called Scottish Gaelic.\nScotsScottisScottisOlder Scots[16][16]Old EnglishScottiscScottisci-mutatedScyttiscScyttisc[24][24]YnglisYnglisInglisInglisScottisScottisGaelic[25][25]ScottisScottis[14][14]:\u200a894\u200a:\u200a894\u200aErseErseWilliam DunbarErseErseGavin DouglasScottisScottis[26][26][27][27]Scottish GaelicHistory[edit]History[edit][edit]Main article: History of the Scots languageHistory of the Scots language The growth and distribution of Scots in Scotland and Ulster[28][29] \u00a0\u00a0Old English by the beginning of the 9th century in the northern portion of the Anglo-Saxon[30] kingdom of Northumbria, now part of Scotland \u00a0\u00a0Early Scots by the beginning of the 15th century \u00a0\u00a0Modern Scots by the mid 20th century The growth and distribution of Scots in Scotland and Ulster[28][29] \u00a0\u00a0Old English by the beginning of the 9th century in the northern portion of the Anglo-Saxon[30] kingdom of Northumbria, now part of Scotland \u00a0\u00a0Early Scots by the beginning of the 15th century \u00a0\u00a0Modern Scots by the mid 20th centuryThe growth and distribution of Scots in Scotland and Ulster[28][29] \u00a0\u00a0Old English by the beginning of the 9th century in the northern portion of the Anglo-Saxon[30] kingdom of Northumbria, now part of Scotland \u00a0\u00a0Early Scots by the beginning of the 15th century \u00a0\u00a0Modern Scots by the mid 20th century[28][28][29][29].mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}\u00a0\u00a0Old English by the beginning of the 9th century in the northern portion of the Anglo-Saxon[30] kingdom of Northumbria, now part of Scotland\u00a0Old EnglishAnglo-Saxon[30][30]Northumbria\u00a0\u00a0Early Scots by the beginning of the 15th century\u00a0Early Scots\u00a0\u00a0Modern Scots by the mid 20th century\u00a0Modern ScotsNorthumbrian Old English had been established in what is now southeastern Scotland as far as the River Forth by the seventh century, as the region was part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria.[31] Middle Irish was the language of the Scottish court, and the common use of Old English remained largely confined to this area until the thirteenth century. The succeeding variety of early northern Middle English spoken in southeastern Scotland is also known as Early Scots. It began to further diverge from the Middle English of Northumbria due to twelfth and thirteenth century immigration of Scandinavian-influenced Middle English-speakers from the North and Midlands of England.[31]:\u200axliii\u200a Later influences on the development of Scots came from the Romance languages via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman French,[31]:\u200alxiii\u2013lxv\u200a and later Parisian French, due to the Auld Alliance. Additionally, there were Dutch and Middle Low German influences due to trade with and immigration from the Low Countries.[31]:\u200alxiii\u200a Scots also includes loan words in the legal and administrative fields resulting from contact with Middle Irish, and reflected in early medieval legal documents.[31]:\u200alxi\u200a Contemporary Scottish Gaelic loans are mainly for geographical and cultural features, such as c\u00e8ilidh, loch and clan. Cumbric and Pictish, the medieval Brittonic languages of Northern England and Scotland, are the suspected source of a small number of Scots words, such as lum (derived from Cumbric) meaning \"chimney\".[32] From the thirteenth century, the Early Scots language spread further into Scotland via the burghs, which were proto-urban institutions first established by King David I. In fourteenth century Scotland, the growth in prestige of Early Scots and the complementary decline of French made Scots the prestige dialect of most of eastern Scotland. By the sixteenth century, Middle Scots had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.[33]\nNorthumbrian Old EnglishRiver ForthAnglo-SaxonNorthumbria[31][31]Middle IrishScottish courtMiddle EnglishEarly ScotsNorthumbriaScandinavian-influencedMidlands[31][31]:\u200axliii\u200a:\u200axliii\u200aRomance languagesecclesiasticalLatinNorman French[31][31]:\u200alxiii\u2013lxv\u200a:\u200alxiii\u2013lxv\u200aParisian FrenchAuld AllianceDutchMiddle Low GermanLow Countries[31][31]:\u200alxiii\u200a:\u200alxiii\u200aMiddle Irish[31][31]:\u200alxi\u200a:\u200alxi\u200aScottish Gaelicc\u00e8ilidhc\u00e8ilidhlochlochclanclanCumbricPictishBrittonic languageslum[32][32]burghsDavid Iprestige dialectMiddle Scots[33][33]From 1610 to the 1690s during the Plantation of Ulster, some 200,000 Scots-speaking Lowlanders settled as colonists in Ulster in Ireland.[34][full citation needed] In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.[35][full citation needed]\nPlantation of Ulster[34][34][full citation needed]full citation neededfull citation neededfull citation needed[35][35][full citation needed]full citation neededfull citation neededfull citation neededThe name Modern Scots is used to describe the Scots language after 1700.[citation needed]\nModern Scots[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededScots was studied alongside English and Scots Gaelic in the Linguistic Survey of Scotland at the University of Edinburgh, which began in 1949 and began to publish results in the 1970s.[36]  Also beginning in the 1970s, the Atlas Linguarum Europae studied the Scots language used at 15 sites in Scotland, each with their own dialect.[37]\nLinguistic Survey of ScotlandLinguistic Survey of ScotlandUniversity of Edinburgh[36][36]Atlas Linguarum EuropaeAtlas Linguarum Europae[37][37]Language shift[edit]Language shift[edit][edit]From the mid-sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.[33]:\u200a10\u200a When William Flower, an English herald, spoke to Mary of Guise and her councillors in 1560, they first used the \"Scottyshe toung\". When he was \"not well understanding\", they switched into her native French.[38] King James VI, who in 1603 became James I of England, observed in his work Some Reulis and Cautelis to Be Observit and Eschewit in Scottis Poesie that \"For albeit sindrie hes written of it in English, quhilk is lykest to our language...\" (For though several have written of (the subject) in English, which is the language most similar to ours...). However, with the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.[33]:\u200a11\u200a In his first speech to the English Parliament in March 1603, King James VI and I declared, \"Hath not God first united these two Kingdomes both in Language, Religion, and similitude of maners?\".[39] Following James VI's move to London, the Protestant Church of Scotland adopted the 1611 Authorized King James Version of the Bible; subsequently, the Acts of Union 1707 led to Scotland joining England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, having a single Parliament of Great Britain based in London. After the Union and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of \"Scottishness\" itself.[40] Many leading Scots of the period, such as David Hume, defined themselves as Northern British rather than Scottish.[40]:\u200a2\u200a They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed union. Nevertheless, Scots was still spoken across a wide range of domains until the end of the eighteenth century.[33]:\u200a11\u200a Frederick Pottle, the twentieth-century biographer of James Boswell (1740\u20131795), described James's view of the use of Scots by his father Alexander Boswell (1706\u20131782)[when?] in the eighteenth century while serving as a judge of the Supreme Courts of Scotland:\nStandard English[33][33]:\u200a10\u200a:\u200a10\u200aWilliam FlowerMary of Guise\"Scottyshe toung\"\"Scottyshe toung\"\"not well understanding\"\"not well understanding\"[38][38]King James VIJames I of EnglandSome Reulis and Cautelis to Be Observit and Eschewit in Scottis PoesieSome Reulis and Cautelis to Be Observit and Eschewit in Scottis Poesie\"For albeit sindrie hes written of it in English, quhilk is lykest to our language...\"\"For albeit sindrie hes written of it in English, quhilk is lykest to our language...\"For though several have written of  in English, which is the language most similar to ours...[33][33]:\u200a11\u200a:\u200a11\u200a\"Hath not God first united these two Kingdomes both in Language, Religion, and similitude of maners?\"\"Hath not God first united these two Kingdomes both in Language, Religion, and similitude of maners?\"[39][39]ProtestantChurch of ScotlandAuthorized King James VersionActs of Union 1707Kingdom of Great BritainParliament of Great Britain[40][40]David HumeNorthern British[40][40]:\u200a2\u200a:\u200a2\u200a[33][33]:\u200a11\u200a:\u200a11\u200aFrederick PottleJames BoswellAlexander Boswell[when?]when?when?when?Supreme Courts of Scotland.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}He scorned modern literature, spoke broad Scots from the bench, and even in writing took no pains to avoid the Scotticisms which most of his colleagues were coming to regard as vulgar.He scorned modern literature, spoke broad Scots from the bench, and even in writing took no pains to avoid the Scotticisms which most of his colleagues were coming to regard as vulgar.However, others did scorn Scots, such as Scottish Enlightenment intellectuals David Hume and Adam Smith, who went to great lengths to get rid of every Scotticism from their writings.[41] Following such examples, many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about \u00a3200 in today's money[42]), they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland. These eighteenth-century activities would lead to the creation of Scottish Standard English.[33]:\u200a13\u200a Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.[33]:\u200a14\u200a\nScottish EnlightenmentAdam Smith[41][41]Thomas Sheridanelocutionguinea[42][42]freemanEdinburghScottish Standard English[33][33]:\u200a13\u200a:\u200a13\u200a[33][33]:\u200a14\u200a:\u200a14\u200a Statue of Robert Burns in Canberra, Australia Statue of Robert Burns in Canberra, AustraliaStatue of Robert Burns in Canberra, AustraliaRobert BurnsCanberra, AustraliaIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the use of Scots as a literary language was revived by several prominent Scotsmen[citation needed] such as Robert Burns. Such writers established a new cross-dialect literary norm.\nliterary language[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededRobert BurnsScots terms were included in the English Dialect Dictionary, edited by Joseph Wright. Wright had great difficulty in recruiting volunteers from Scotland, as many refused to cooperate with a venture that regarded Scots as a dialect of English, and he obtained enough help only through the assistance from a Professor Shearer in Scotland.[43] Wright himself rejected the argument that Scots was a separate language, saying that this was a \"quite modern mistake\".[43]\nEnglish Dialect DictionaryJoseph Wright[43][43][43][43]During the first half of the twentieth century, knowledge of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary norms waned, and as of 2006[update],  there is no institutionalised standard literary form.[44] By the 1940s, the Scottish Education Department's language policy was that Scots had no value: \"it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture\".[45] Students reverted to Scots outside the classroom, but the reversion was not complete. What occurred, and has been occurring ever since, is a process of language attrition, whereby successive generations have adopted more and more features from Standard English. This process has accelerated rapidly since widespread access to mass media in English and increased population mobility became available after the Second World War.[33]:\u200a15\u200a It has recently taken on the nature of wholesale language shift, sometimes also termed language change, convergence or merger. By the end of the twentieth century, Scots was at an advanced stage of language death over much of Lowland Scotland.[46] Residual features of Scots are often regarded as slang.[47] A 2010 Scottish Government study of \"public attitudes towards the Scots language\" found that 64% of respondents (around 1,000 individuals in a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) \"don't really think of Scots as a language\", also finding \"the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%)\".[48]\n[update][update][44][44]Scottish Education Departmentlanguage policy[45][45]language attritionSecond World War[33][33]:\u200a15\u200a:\u200a15\u200alanguage shiftchangeconvergencemergerlanguage deathLowland Scotland[46][46][47][47]Scottish Governmentrepresentative sample[48][48]Decline in status[edit]Decline in status[edit][edit] Lufe God abufe al and yi nychtbour as yi self (\"Love God above all and thy neighbour as thyself\"), an example of Early Scots, on John Knox House, Edinburgh Lufe God abufe al and yi nychtbour as yi self (\"Love God above all and thy neighbour as thyself\"), an example of Early Scots, on John Knox House, EdinburghLufe God abufe al and yi nychtbour as yi self (\"Love God above all and thy neighbour as thyself\"), an example of Early Scots, on John Knox House, EdinburghLufe God abufe al and yi nychtbour as yi selfLufe God abufe al and yi nychtbour as yi selfEarly ScotsJohn Knox HouseBefore the Treaty of Union 1707, when Scotland and England joined to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, there is ample evidence that Scots was widely held to be an independent sister language[49] forming a pluricentric diasystem with English.\nTreaty of Union 1707sister language[49][49]pluricentricdiasystemGerman linguist Heinz Kloss considered Modern Scots a Halbsprache ('half language') in terms of an abstand and ausbau languages framework,[50] although today in Scotland most people's speech is somewhere on a continuum ranging from traditional broad Scots to Scottish Standard English. Many speakers are diglossic and may be able to code-switch along the continuum depending on the situation. Where on this continuum English-influenced Scots becomes Scots-influenced English is difficult to determine. Because standard English now generally has the role of a Dachsprache ('roofing language'), disputes often arise as to whether the varieties of Scots are dialects of Scottish English or constitute a separate language in their own right.[51][52]\nHeinz KlossHeinz KlossHeinz KlossHalbspracheHalbspracheabstand and ausbau languagesabstandabstandausbauausbau[50][50]Scottish Standard Englishdiglossiccode-switchDachspracheDachspracheDachsprache[51][51][52][52]The UK government now accepts Scots as a regional language and has recognised it as such under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[53]\nregional languageEuropean Charter for Regional or Minority Languages[53][53]Notwithstanding the UK government's and the Scottish Executive's obligations under part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Scottish Executive recognises and respects Scots (in all its forms) as a distinct language, and does not consider the use of Scots to be an indication of poor competence in English.Notwithstanding the UK government's and the Scottish Executive's obligations under part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Scottish Executive recognises and respects Scots (in all its forms) as a distinct language, and does not consider the use of Scots to be an indication of poor competence in English.Evidence for its existence as a separate language lies in the extensive body of Scots literature, its independent \u2013 if somewhat fluid \u2013 orthographic conventions, and in its former use as the language of the original Parliament of Scotland.[54] Because Scotland retained distinct political, legal, and religious systems after the Union, many Scots terms passed into Scottish English.\northographic conventionsParliament of Scotland[54][54]Language revitalisation[edit]Language revitalisation[edit][edit] William Wye Smith's The New Testament in Braid Scots William Wye Smith's The New Testament in Braid ScotsWilliam Wye Smith's The New Testament in Braid ScotsThe New Testament in Braid ScotsNew TestamentDuring the 2010s, increased interest was expressed in the language.\nEducation[edit]Education[edit][edit]The status of the language was raised in Scottish schools,[55] with Scots being included in the new national school curriculum.[56] Previously in Scotland's schools there had been little education taking place through the medium of Scots, although it may have been covered superficially in English lessons, which could entail reading some Scots literature and observing the local dialect. Much of the material used was often Standard English disguised as Scots, which caused upset among proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots alike.[57] One example of the educational establishment's approach to Scots is, \"Write a poem in Scots. (It is important not to be worried about spelling in this \u2013 write as you hear the sounds in your head.)\",[58] whereas guidelines for English require teaching pupils to be \"writing fluently and legibly with accurate spelling and punctuation\".[59]\n[55][55]curriculum[56][56]medium[57][57][58][58][59][59]A course in Scots language and culture delivered through the medium of Standard English and produced by the Open University (OU) in Scotland, the Open University's School of Languages and Applied Linguistics as well as Education Scotland became available online for the first time in December 2019.[60]\nOpen University (OU)Education Scotland[60][60]Government[edit]Government[edit][edit]In the 2011 Scottish census, a question on Scots language ability was featured[9] and is planned to be included again in the 2022 census.[61]\n2011 Scottish census[9][9][61][61]The Scottish government set its first Scots Language Policy in 2015, in which it pledged to support its preservation and encourage respect, recognition and use of Scots.[9] The Scottish Parliament website also offers some information on the language in Scots.[62]\n[9][9][62][62]Media[edit]Media[edit][edit]Serious use of the language for news, encyclopaedias, documentaries, etc., remains rare and usually reserved for niches where it is deemed acceptable, e.g. comedy, Burns Night, or representations of traditions and times gone by. However, since 2016 The National newspaper has regularly published some news articles in the language.[63] The 2010s also saw an increasing number of English books translated in Scots and becoming widely available, particularly those in popular children's fiction series such as The Gruffalo, Harry Potter and several by Roald Dahl[64] and David Walliams.[65] In 2021, the music streaming service Spotify created a Scots language listing.[66]\nBurns NightThe National newspaper[63][63]children's fictionThe GruffaloThe GruffaloHarry PotterHarry PotterRoald Dahl[64][64]David Walliams[65][65]Spotify[66][66]Geographic distribution[edit]Geographic distribution[edit][edit]In Scotland, Scots is spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, the Northern Isles, Caithness, Arran and Campbeltown. In Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, its area is usually defined through the works of Robert John Gregg to include the counties of Down, Antrim, Londonderry and Donegal (especially in East Donegal and Inishowen).[67] More recently, the Fintona-born linguist Warren Maguire has argued that some of the criteria that Gregg used as distinctive of Ulster Scots are common in south-west Tyrone and were found in other sites across Northern Ireland investigated by the Linguistic Survey of Scotland.[68] Dialects of Scots include Insular Scots, Northern Scots, Central Scots, Southern Scots and Ulster Scots.\nScottish LowlandsNorthern IslesCaithnessArranCampbeltownUlsterprovinceIrelandRobert John GreggcountiesDownAntrimLondonderryDonegalInishowen[67][67]FintonaLinguistic Survey of Scotland[68][68]Insular ScotsNorthern ScotsCentral ScotsSouthern ScotsUlster ScotsIt has been difficult to determine the number of speakers of Scots via census, because many respondents might interpret the question \"Do you speak Scots?\" in different ways. Campaigners for Scots pressed for this question to be included in the 2001 UK National Census. The results from a 1996 trial before the Census, by the General Register Office for Scotland (GRO),[69] suggested that there were around 1.5\u00a0million speakers of Scots, with 30% of Scots responding \"Yes\" to the question \"Can you speak the Scots language?\", but only 17% responding \"Aye\" to the question \"Can you speak Scots?\".[citation needed] It was also found that older, working-class people were more likely to answer in the affirmative. The University of Aberdeen Scots Leid Quorum performed its own research in 1995, cautiously suggesting that there were 2.7\u00a0million speakers, though with clarification as to why these figures required context.[70]\n2001 UK National CensusGeneral Register Office for Scotland[69][69][citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededUniversity of Aberdeen[70][70]The GRO questions, as freely acknowledged by those who set them, were not as detailed and systematic as the University of Aberdeen ones, and only included reared speakers (people raised speaking Scots), not those who had learned the language. Part of the difference resulted from the central question posed by surveys: \"Do you speak Scots?\". In the Aberdeen University study, the question was augmented with the further clause \"...\u00a0or a dialect of Scots such as Border etc.\", which resulted in greater recognition from respondents. The GRO concluded that there simply was not enough linguistic self-awareness amongst the Scottish populace, with people still thinking of themselves as speaking badly pronounced, grammatically inferior English rather than Scots, for an accurate census to be taken. The GRO research concluded that \"[a] more precise estimate of genuine Scots language ability would require a more in-depth interview survey and may involve asking various questions about the language used in different situations. Such an approach would be inappropriate for a Census.\" Thus, although it was acknowledged that the \"inclusion of such a Census question would undoubtedly raise the profile of Scots\", no question about Scots was, in the end, included in the 2001 Census.[51][71][72] The Scottish Government's Pupils in Scotland Census 2008[73] found that 306 pupils[clarification needed] spoke Scots as their main home language. A Scottish Government study in 2010 found that 85% of around 1000 respondents (being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) claim to speak Scots to varying degrees.[48]\nUniversity of Aberdeen[51][51][71][71][72][72]Pupils in Scotland Census 2008[73][73][clarification needed]clarification neededclarification neededclarification neededScottish Government[48][48]The 2011 UK census was the first to ask residents of Scotland about Scots. A campaign called Aye Can was set up to help individuals answer the question.[74][75] The specific wording used was \"Which of these can you do? Tick all that apply\" with options for \"Understand\", \"Speak\", \"Read\" and \"Write\" in three columns: English, Scottish Gaelic and Scots.[76] Of approximately 5.1\u00a0million respondents, about 1.2\u00a0million (24%) could speak, read and write Scots, 3.2\u00a0million (62%) had no skills in Scots and the remainder had some degree of skill, such as understanding Scots (0.27\u00a0million, 5.2%) or being able to speak it but not read or write it (0.18\u00a0million, 3.5%).[77] There were also small numbers of Scots speakers recorded in England and Wales on the 2011 Census, with the largest numbers being either in bordering areas (e.g. Carlisle) or in areas that had recruited large numbers of Scottish workers in the past (e.g. Corby or the former mining areas of Kent).[78]\n2011 UK censusAye Can[74][74][75][75][76][76][77][77]CarlisleCorbyKent[78][78]Literature[edit]Literature[edit][edit]Main article: Scots-language literatureScots-language literatureAmong the earliest Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (fourteenth century), Wyntoun's Cronykil and Blind Harry's The Wallace (fifteenth century). From the fifteenth century, much literature based on the Royal Court in Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews was produced by writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Gavin Douglas and David Lyndsay. The Complaynt of Scotland was an early printed work in Scots.

Other contemporaries were Douglas Young, John Buchan, Sydney Goodsir Smith, Robert Garioch, Edith Anne Robertson and Robert McLellan.

After the Acts of Union in 1707 the emerging Scottish form of Standard English replaced Scots for most formal writing in Scotland.[33]:\u200a11\u200a\nThe eighteenth-century Scots revival saw the introduction of a new literary language descended from the old court Scots, but with an orthography that had abandoned some of the more distinctive old Scots spellings[90] and adopted many standard English spellings. Despite the updated spelling, however, the rhymes make it clear that a Scots pronunciation was intended.[91] These writings also introduced what came to be known as the apologetic apostrophe,[91]:\u200axiv\u200a generally occurring where a consonant exists in the Standard English cognate. This Written Scots drew not only on the vernacular, but also on the King James Bible, and was heavily influenced by the norms and conventions of Augustan English poetry.[14]:\u200a168\u200a Consequently, this written Scots looked very similar to contemporary Standard English, suggesting a somewhat modified version of that, rather than a distinct speech form with a phonological system which had been developing independently for many centuries.[92] This modern literary dialect, \"Scots of the book\" or Standard Scots,[93][94] once again gave Scots an orthography of its own, lacking neither \"authority nor author\".[95] This literary language used throughout Lowland Scotland and Ulster,[96] embodied by writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Murray, David Herbison, James Orr, James Hogg and William Laidlaw among others, is well described in the 1921 Manual of Modern Scots.[97]\northographyEarly Scots[87][87][88][88]Union of the CrownsStandard English[89][89]Acts of UnionScottish form of Standard English[33][33]:\u200a11\u200a:\u200a11\u200aliterary language[90][90][91][91]apologetic apostrophe[91][91]:\u200axiv\u200a:\u200axiv\u200aconsonantcognateKing James BibleAugustan English poetry[14][14]:\u200a168\u200a:\u200a168\u200a[92][92][93][93][94][94][95][95][96][96]Charles MurrayDavid HerbisonJames HoggWilliam LaidlawManual of Modern Scots[97][97]Other authors developed dialect writing, preferring to represent their own speech in a more phonological manner rather than following the pan-dialect conventions of modern literary Scots,[91] especially for the northern[98] and insular dialects of Scots.\n[91][91][98][98]During the twentieth century, a number of proposals for spelling reform were presented. Commenting on this, John Corbett (2003: 260) writes that \"devising a normative orthography for Scots has been one of the greatest linguistic hobbies of the past century\". Most proposals entailed regularising the use of established eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conventions, in particular the avoidance of the apologetic apostrophe, which represented letters that were perceived to be missing when compared to the corresponding English cognates but were never actually present in the Scots word.[99][100] For example, in the fourteenth century, Barbour spelt the Scots cognate of \"taken\" as tane. It is argued that, because there has been no k in the word for over 700 years, representing its omission with an apostrophe is of little value.

As a Goidelic language, Scottish Gaelic, as well as both Irish and Manx, developed out of Old Irish.[4] It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period, although a common literary language was shared by Gaels in both Ireland and Scotland down to the 16th century.[5] Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language place names.[6][7]\nIn the 2011 census of Scotland, 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over 3 years old) reported being able to speak Gaelic, 1,275 fewer than in 2001. The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, there are revival efforts, and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.[8] Outside Scotland, a dialect known as Canadian Gaelic has been spoken in eastern Canada since the 18th century. In the 2016 national census, nearly 4,000 Canadian residents claimed knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, with a particular concentration in Nova Scotia.[9][10]\nScottish Gaelic is not an official language of the United Kingdom. However, it is classed as an indigenous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which the UK Government has ratified, and the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 established a language-development body, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig.[11]\n\nContents\n\n1 Name\n2 History\n\n2.1 Origins\n2.2 Decline\n2.3 Modern era\n2.4 Defunct dialects\n\n\n3 Status\n\n3.1 Number of speakers\n3.2 Distribution in Scotland\n\n\n4 Usage\n\n4.1 Official\n\n4.1.1 Scotland\n\n4.1.1.1 Scottish Parliament\n4.1.1.2 Qualifications in the language\n4.1.1.3 European Union\n4.1.1.4 Signage\n\n\n4.1.2 Canada\n\n4.1.2.1 Nova Scotia\n4.1.2.2 Outside Nova Scotia\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Media\n4.3 Education\n\n4.3.1 Scotland\n4.3.2 Canada\n4.3.3 Higher and further education\n\n\n4.4 Church\n4.5 Literature\n4.6 Names\n\n4.6.1 Personal names\n4.6.2 Surnames\n\n\n\n\n5 Phonology\n6 Grammar\n\n6.1 Noun inflection\n6.2 Verb inflection\n6.3 Word order\n\n\n7 Lexicon\n\n7.1 Loanwords into other languages\n\n\n8 Orthography\n\n8.1 Alphabet\n\n\n9 Example text\n10 Common words and phrases with Irish and Manx equivalents\n11 References\n\n11.1 Notes\n11.2 Citations\n11.3 Resources\n11.4 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nName[edit]\nAside from \"Scottish Gaelic\", the language may also be referred to simply as \"Gaelic\", pronounced /\u02c8\u0261\u00e6l\u026ak/ in English. However, \"Gaelic\" /\u02c8\u0261e\u026al\u026ak/ also refers to the Irish language (Gaeilge)[12] and the Manx language (Gaelg).\nScottish Gaelic is distinct from Scots, the Middle English-derived language which had come to be spoken in most of the Lowlands of Scotland by the early modern era. Prior to the 15th century, this language was known as Inglis (\"English\")[13] by its own speakers, with Gaelic being called Scottis (\"Scottish\"). Beginning in the late 15th century, it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as Erse (\"Irish\") and the Lowland vernacular as Scottis.[14] Today, Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish, so the word Erse in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used.[15]\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain articles: History of the Irish language and History of Scottish Gaelic\nOrigins[edit]\nFurther information: History of the Irish language, Primitive Irish, Old Irish, Middle Irish, and Early Modern Irish\n Place names in Scotland that contain the element bal- from the Scottish Gaelic baile meaning home, farmstead, town or city. These data give some indication of the extent of medieval Gaelic settlement in Scotland.\nBased on medieval traditional accounts and the apparent evidence from linguistic geography, Gaelic has been commonly believed to have been brought to Scotland, in the 4th\u20135th centuries CE, by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata on Scotland's west coast in present-day Argyll.[16]:\u200a551\u200a[17]:\u200a66\u200a An alternative view has been voiced by archaeologist Dr Ewan Campbell, who has argued that the putative migration or takeover is not reflected in archaeological or placename data (as pointed out earlier by Leslie Alcock). Campbell has also questioned the age and reliability of the medieval historical sources speaking of a conquest. Instead, he has inferred that Argyll formed part of a common Q-Celtic-speaking area with Ireland, connected rather than divided by the sea, since the Iron Age.[18] These arguments have been opposed by some scholars defending the early dating of the traditional accounts and arguing for other interpretations of the archaeological evidence.[19]\nRegardless of how it came to be spoken in the region, Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to D\u00e1l Riata until the eighth century, when it began expanding into Pictish areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. During the reign of Caustant\u00edn mac \u00c1eda (Constantine II, 900\u2013943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than as the kingdom of the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of Caustant\u00edn and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten.[20]  Bilingualism in Pictish and Gaelic, prior to the former's extinction, led to the presence of Pictish loanwords in Gaelic[21] and syntactic influence[22]  which could be considered to constitute a Pictish substrate.[23]\nIn 1018, after the conquest of the Lothians by the Kingdom of Scotland, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith.[24]:\u200a16\u201318\u200a Colloquial speech in Scotland had been developing independently of that in Ireland since the eighth century.[25] For the first time, the entire region of modern-day Scotland was called Scotia in Latin, and Gaelic was the lingua Scotica.[26]:\u200a276\u200a[27]:\u200a554\u200a In southern Scotland, Gaelic was strong in Galloway, adjoining areas to the north and west, West Lothian, and parts of western Midlothian. It was spoken to a lesser degree in north Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, the Clyde Valley and eastern Dumfriesshire. In south-eastern Scotland, there is no evidence that Gaelic was ever widely spoken.[28]\n\nDecline[edit]\n Linguistic division in early 12th century Scotland. \u00a0\u00a0Gaelic speaking \u00a0\u00a0Norse-Gaelic zone, use of either or both languages \u00a0\u00a0English-speaking zone \u00a0\u00a0Cumbric may have survived in this zone\nMany historians mark the reign of King Malcolm Canmore (Malcolm III) between 1058 and 1093 as the beginning of Gaelic's eclipse in Scotland. His wife Margaret of Wessex spoke no Gaelic, gave her children Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic names, and brought many English bishops, priests, and monastics to Scotland.[24]:\u200a19\u200a When Malcolm and Margaret died in 1093, the Gaelic aristocracy rejected their anglicised sons and instead backed Malcolm's brother Donald B\u00e0n (Donald III).[citation needed] Donald had spent 17 years in Gaelic Ireland and his power base was in the thoroughly Gaelic west of Scotland. He was the last Scottish monarch to be buried on Iona, the traditional burial place of the Gaelic Kings of D\u00e0l Riada and the Kingdom of Alba.[citation needed] However, during the reigns of Malcolm Canmore's sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I (their successive reigns lasting 1097\u20131153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth\u2013Clyde line and along the northeastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under David I, attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking Old English. This was the beginning of Gaelic's status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.[24]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a\nClan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there. The semi-independent Lordship of the Isles in the Hebrides and western coastal mainland remained thoroughly Gaelic since the language's recovery there in the 12th century, providing a political foundation for cultural prestige down to the end of the 15th century.[27]:\u200a553\u20136\u200a\n\nLinguistic divide in the middle ages. Left: divide in 1400 after Loch, 1932; Right: divide in 1500 after Nicholson, 1974 (both reproduced from Withers, 1984)\n\u00a0\u00a0Gaelic\n\u00a0\u00a0Scots\n\u00a0\u00a0Norn\nBy the mid-14th century what eventually came to be called Scots (at that time termed Inglis) emerged as the official language of government and law.[29]:\u200a139\u200a Scotland's emergent nationalism in the era following the conclusion of the Wars of Scottish Independence was organized using Scots as well. For example, the nation's great patriotic literature including John Barbour's The Brus (1375) and Blind Harry's The Wallace (before 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. By the end of the 15th century, English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as 'Yrisch' or 'Erse', i.e. Irish and their own language as 'Scottis'.[24]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a\n\nModern era[edit]\nA steady shift away from Scottish Gaelic continued into and through the modern era. Some of this was driven by policy decisions by government or other organisations, some originated from social changes. In the last quarter of the 20th century, efforts began to encourage use of the language.\nThe Statutes of Iona, enacted by James VI in 1609, was one piece of legislation that addressed, among other things, the Gaelic language. It compelled the heirs of clan chiefs to be educated in lowland, Protestant, English-speaking schools. James VI took several such measures to impose his rule on the Highland and Island region. In 1616 the Privy Council proclaimed that schools teaching in English should be established. Gaelic was seen, at this time, as one of the causes of the instability of the region. It was also associated with Catholicism.[30]:\u200a110\u2013113\u200a\nThe Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was founded in 1709. They met in 1716, immediately after the failed Jacobite rebellion of 1715, to consider the reform and civilisation of the Highlands, which they sought to achieve by teaching English and the Protestant religion. Initially their teaching was entirely in English, but soon the impracticality of educating Gaelic-speaking children in this way gave rise to a modest concession: in 1723 teachers were allowed to translate English words in the Bible into Gaelic to aid comprehension, but there was no further permitted use. Other less prominent schools worked in the Highlands at the same time, also teaching in English. This process of anglicisation paused when evangelical preachers arrived in the Highlands, convinced that people should be able to read religious texts in their own language. The first well-known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767 when Dr James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. In 1798 4 tracts in Gaelic were published by the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home. 5,000 copies of each were printed. Other publications followed, with a full Gaelic Bible in 1801. The influential and effective Gaelic Schools Society was founded in 1811. Their purpose was to teach Gaels to read the Bible in their own language. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the SSPCK (despite their anti-Gaelic attitude in prior years) and the British and Foreign Bible Society distributed 60,000 Gaelic Bibles and 80,000 New Testaments.[31]:\u200a98\u200a It is estimated that this overall schooling and publishing effort gave some 300,000 people in the Highlands some basic literacy.[30]:\u200a110\u2013117\u200a Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible; the lack of a well-known translation may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic.[32]:\u200a168\u2013202\u200a\n\n 1891 distribution of English (including Scots) and Gaelic in Scotland  \u00a0\u00a075\u201380% Gaelic, and English \u2501\u00a025\u201375% Gaelic, and English; line indicates the 50% isogloss  \u00a0\u00a05\u201325% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a00\u20135% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a0Purely English\nCounterintuitively, access to schooling in Gaelic increased knowledge of English. In 1829 the Gaelic Schools Society reported that parents were unconcerned about their children learning Gaelic, but were anxious to have them taught English. The SSPCK also found Highlanders to have significant prejudice against Gaelic. T. M. Devine attributes this to an association between English and the prosperity of employment: the Highland economy relied greatly on seasonal migrant workers travelling outside the G\u00e0idhealtachd. In 1863, an observer sympathetic to Gaelic stated that \"knowledge of English is indispensable to any poor islander who wishes to learn a trade or to earn his bread beyond the limits of his native Isle\". Generally, rather than Gaelic speakers, it was Celtic societies in the cities and professors of Celtic from universities who sought to preserve the language.[30]:\u200a116\u2013117\u200a\nThe Education (Scotland) Act 1872 provided universal education in Scotland, but completely ignored Gaelic in its plans. The mechanism for supporting Gaelic through the Education Codes issued by the Scottish Education Department were steadily used to overcome this omission, with many concessions in place by 1918. However, the members of Highland school boards tended to have anti-Gaelic attitudes and served as an obstacle to Gaelic education in the late 19th and early 20th century.[30]:\u200a110\u2013111\u200a\nThe Linguistic Survey of Scotland surveyed both the dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language, and also mixed use of English and Gaelic across the Highlands and Islands.[33]\n\nDefunct dialects[edit]\nDialects of Lowland Gaelic have been defunct since the 18th century. Gaelic in the Eastern and Southern Scottish Highlands, although alive until the mid-20th century, is now largely defunct. Although modern Scottish Gaelic is dominated by the dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye, there remain some speakers of the Inner Hebridean dialects of Tiree and Islay, and even a few native speakers from Western Highland areas including Wester Ross, northwest Sutherland, Lochaber and Argyll. Dialects on both sides of the Straits of Moyle (the North Channel) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the Mull of Kintyre, on Rathlin and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary.[34] Some features of moribund dialects have been preserved in Nova Scotia, including the pronunciation of the broad or velarised l (l\u032a\u02e0) as [w], as in the Lochaber dialect.[35]:\u200a131\u200a\n\nStatus[edit]\n\n\nThis section needs expansion with: preservation and revitalization efforts; Canadian Gaelic stats. You can help by adding to it.

The 2011 total population figure comes from table KS101SC. Note that the numbers of Gaelic speakers relate to the numbers aged 3 and over, and the percentages are calculated using those and the number of the total population aged 3 and over.\n\nDistribution in Scotland[edit]\n A Scottish Gaelic speaker, recorded in Scotland.\n\nThe 2011 UK Census showed a total of 57,375 Gaelic speakers in Scotland (1.1% of population over three years old), of whom only 32,400 could also read and write the language.[40] Compared with the 2001 Census, there has been a diminution of about 1300 people.[41] This is the smallest drop between censuses since the Gaelic-language question was first asked in 1881. The Scottish government's language minister and B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig took this as evidence that Gaelic's long decline has slowed.[42]\nThe main stronghold of the language continues to be the Outer Hebrides (Na h-Eileanan Siar), where the overall proportion of speakers is 52.2%. Important pockets of the language also exist in the Highlands (5.4%) and in Argyll and Bute (4.0%) and Inverness (4.9%). The locality with the largest absolute number is Glasgow with 5,878 such persons, who make up over 10% of all of Scotland's Gaelic speakers.\n\n Cumbernauld Gaelic Choir in 2021\nGaelic continues to decline in its traditional heartland. Between 2001 and 2011, the absolute number of Gaelic speakers fell sharply in the Western Isles (\u22121,745), Argyll & Bute (\u2212694), and Highland (\u2212634). The drop in Stornoway, the largest parish in the Western Isles by population, was especially acute, from 57.5% of the population in 1991 to 43.4% in 2011.[43] The only parish outside the Western Isles over 40% Gaelic-speaking is Kilmuir in Northern Skye at 46%. The islands in the Inner Hebrides with significant percentages of Gaelic speakers are Tiree (38.3%), Raasay (30.4%), Skye (29.4%), Lismore (26.9%), Colonsay (20.2%), and Islay (19.0%).\nToday, no civil parish in Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 65% (the highest value is in Barvas, Lewis, with 64.1%). In addition, no civil parish on mainland Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 20% (the highest is in Ardnamurchan, Highland, with 19.3%). Out of a total of 871 civil parishes in Scotland, the proportion of Gaelic speakers exceeds 50% in seven parishes, 25% in 14 parishes, and 10% in 35 parishes. \nDecline in traditional areas has recently been balanced by growth in the Scottish Lowlands. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the number of Gaelic speakers rose in nineteen of the country's 32 council areas. The largest absolute gains were in Aberdeenshire (+526), North Lanarkshire (+305), Aberdeen City (+216), and East Ayrshire (+208). The largest relative gains were in Aberdeenshire (+0.19%), East Ayrshire (+0.18%), Moray (+0.16%), and Orkney (+0.13%).[citation needed]\nIn 2018, the census of pupils in Scotland showed 520 students in publicly funded schools had Gaelic as the main language at home, an increase of 5% from 497 in 2014. During the same period, Gaelic medium education in Scotland has grown, with 4,343 pupils (6.3 per 1000) being educated in a Gaelic-immersion environment in 2018, up from 3,583 pupils (5.3 per 1000) in 2014.[44] Data collected in 2007\u20132008 indicated that even among pupils enrolled in Gaelic medium schools, 81% of primary students and 74% of secondary students report using English more often than Gaelic when speaking with their mothers at home.[45] The effect on this of the significant increase in pupils in Gaelic-medium education since that time is unknown.\n\nUsage[edit]\nOfficial[edit]\nScotland[edit]\nScottish Parliament[edit]\n Anne Lorne Gillies speaking publicly in the Scottish Gaelic language\nGaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts and was long suppressed.[46]\nThe UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Gaelic. Gaelic, along with Irish and Welsh, is designated under Part III of the Charter, which requires the UK Government to take a range of concrete measures in the fields of education, justice, public administration, broadcasting and culture. It has not received the same degree of official recognition from the UK Government as Welsh. With the advent of devolution, however, Scottish matters have begun to receive greater attention, and it achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament on 21 April 2005.\nThe key provisions of the Act are:[47]\n\nEstablishing the Gaelic development body, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig (BnG), on a statutory basis with a view to securing the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland commanding equal respect to the English language and to promote the use and understanding of Gaelic.\nRequiring BnG to prepare a National Gaelic Language Plan every five years for approval by Scottish Ministers.\nRequiring BnG to produce guidance on Gaelic medium education and Gaelic as a subject for education authorities.\nRequiring public bodies in Scotland, both Scottish public bodies and cross-border public bodies insofar as they carry out devolved functions, to develop Gaelic language plans in relation to the services they offer, if requested to do so by BnG.\nFollowing a consultation period, in which the government received many submissions, the majority of which asked that the bill be strengthened, a revised bill was published; the main alteration was that the guidance of the B\u00f2rd is now statutory (rather than advisory). In the committee stages in the Scottish Parliament, there was much debate over whether Gaelic should be given 'equal validity' with English. Due to executive concerns about resourcing implications if this wording was used, the Education Committee settled on the concept of 'equal respect'. It is not clear what the legal force of this wording is.\nThe Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament unanimously, with support from all sectors of the Scottish political spectrum, on 21 April 2005. Under the provisions of the Act, it will ultimately fall to BnG to secure the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland.\n\n Police Scotland vehicle logo (Bilingual)\nSome commentators, such as \u00c9amonn \u00d3 Grib\u00edn (2006) argue that the Gaelic Act falls so far short of the status accorded to Welsh that one would be foolish or na\u00efve to believe that any substantial change will occur in the fortunes of the language as a result of B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig's efforts.[48]\nOn 10 December 2008, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Scottish Human Rights Commission had the UDHR translated into Gaelic for the first time.[49]\nHowever, given there are no longer any monolingual Gaelic speakers,[50] following an appeal in the court case of Taylor v Haughney (1982), involving the status of Gaelic in judicial proceedings, the High Court ruled against a general right to use Gaelic in court proceedings.[51]\n\nQualifications in the language[edit]\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority offer two streams of Gaelic examination across all levels of the syllabus: Gaelic for learners (equivalent to the modern foreign languages syllabus) and Gaelic for native speakers (equivalent to the English syllabus).[52][53]\nAn Comunn G\u00e0idhealach performs assessment of spoken Gaelic, resulting in the issue of a Bronze Card, Silver Card or Gold Card. Syllabus details are available on An Comunn's website. These are not widely recognised as qualifications, but are required for those taking part in certain competitions at the annual mods.[54]\n\nEuropean Union[edit]\nThis section needs to be updated. The reason given is: The UK has now left the EU. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2020)\nIn October 2009, a new agreement allowed Scottish Gaelic to be formally used between Scottish Government ministers and European Union officials. The deal was signed by Britain's representative to the EU, Sir Kim Darroch, and the Scottish government. This did not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU but gave it the right to be a means of formal communications in the EU's institutions. The Scottish government had to pay for the translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government's support for Gaelic. He said; \"Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed\".[citation needed] Culture Minister Mike Russell said; \"this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad and I look forward to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon. Seeing Gaelic spoken in such a forum raises the profile of the language as we drive forward our commitment to creating a new generation of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.\"[55]\n\nSignage[edit]\nSee also: Ainmean-\u00c0ite na h-Alba\n Bilingual Gaelic\u2013English road sign in Scotland\n Monolingual Gaelic direction sign, at Rodel (Roghadal) on Harris in the Outer Hebrides\n Bilingual English/Gaelic sign at Queen Street Station in Glasgow\nBilingual road signs, street names, business and advertisement signage (in both Gaelic and English) are gradually being introduced throughout Gaelic-speaking regions in the Highlands and Islands, including Argyll. In many cases, this has simply meant re-adopting the traditional spelling of a name (such as R\u00e0tagan or Loch Ailleart rather than the anglicised forms Ratagan or Lochailort respectively).[56]\nSome monolingual Gaelic road signs, particularly direction signs, are used on the Outer Hebrides, where a majority of the population can have a working knowledge of the language. These omit the English translation entirely.\nBilingual railway station signs are now more frequent than they used to be. Practically all the stations in the Highland area use both English and Gaelic, and the use of bilingual station signs has become more frequent in the Lowlands of Scotland, including areas where Gaelic has not been spoken for a long time.[citation needed]\nThis has been welcomed by many supporters of the language as a means of raising its profile as well as securing its future as a 'living language' (i.e. allowing people to use it to navigate from A to B in place of English) and creating a sense of place. However, in some places, such as Caithness, the Highland Council's intention to introduce bilingual signage has incited controversy.[57]\nThe Ordnance Survey has acted in recent years to correct many of the mistakes that appear on maps. They announced in 2004 that they intended to correct them and set up a committee to determine the correct forms of Gaelic place names for their maps.[56] Ainmean-\u00c0ite na h-Alba (\"Place names in Scotland\") is the national advisory partnership for Gaelic place names in Scotland.[58]\n\nCanada[edit]\nMain article: Canadian Gaelic\nIn the nineteenth century, Canadian Gaelic was the third-most widely spoken European language in British North America[59] and Gaelic-speaking immigrant communities could be found throughout what is modern-day Canada. Gaelic poets in Canada produced a significant literary tradition.[60] The number of Gaelic-speaking individuals and communities declined sharply, however, after the First World War.[61]\n\nNova Scotia[edit]\n Antigonish, Nova Scotia\nAt the start of the 21st century, it was estimated that no more than 500 people in Nova Scotia still spoke Scottish Gaelic as a first language. In the 2011 census, 300 people claimed to have Gaelic as their first language (a figure that may include Irish Gaelic).[62] In the same 2011 census, 1,275 people claimed to speak Gaelic, a figure that not only included all Gaelic languages but also those people who are not first language speakers,[63] of whom 300 claim to have Gaelic as their \"mother tongue.\"[64][a]\nThe Nova Scotia government maintains the Office of Gaelic Affairs (Iomairtean na G\u00e0idhlig), which is dedicated to the development of Scottish Gaelic language, culture and tourism in Nova Scotia, and which estimates about 2,000 total Gaelic speakers to be in the province.[10] As in Scotland, areas of North-Eastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton have bilingual street signs. Nova Scotia also has Comhairle na G\u00e0idhlig (The Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia), a non-profit society dedicated to the maintenance and promotion of the Gaelic language and culture in Maritime Canada. In 2018, the Nova Scotia government launched a new Gaelic vehicle license plate to raise awareness of the language and help fund Gaelic language and culture initiatives.[66]\nIn September 2021, the first Gaelic-medium primary school outside of Scotland, named Taigh Sgoile na Drochaide, opened in Mabou, Nova Scotia.[67]\n\nOutside Nova Scotia[edit]\nMaxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly.[68]\nIn Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School now offers both an introductory and an advanced course in Gaelic; both language and history are taught in these classes.[citation needed] This is the first recorded time that Gaelic has ever been taught as an official course on Prince Edward Island.\nThe province of British Columbia is host to the Comunn G\u00e0idhlig Bhancoubhair (The Gaelic Society of Vancouver), the Vancouver Gaelic Choir, the Victoria Gaelic Choir, as well as the annual Gaelic festival M\u00f2d Vancouver. The city of Vancouver's Scottish Cultural Centre also holds seasonal Scottish Gaelic evening classes.\n\nMedia[edit]\nMain article: Gaelic broadcasting in Scotland\nThe BBC operates a Gaelic-language radio station Radio nan G\u00e0idheal as well as a television channel, BBC Alba. Launched on 19 September 2008, BBC Alba is widely available in the UK (on Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media). It also broadcasts across Europe on the Astra 2 satellites.[69] The channel is being operated in partnership between BBC Scotland and MG Alba \u2013 an organisation funded by the Scottish Government, which works to promote the Gaelic language in broadcasting.[70] The ITV franchise in central Scotland, STV Central, produces a number of Scottish Gaelic programmes for both BBC Alba and its own main channel.[70]\nUntil BBC Alba was broadcast on Freeview, viewers were able to receive the channel TeleG, which broadcast for an hour every evening. Upon BBC Alba's launch on Freeview, it took the channel number that was previously assigned to TeleG.\nThere are also television programmes in the language on other BBC channels and on the independent commercial channels, usually subtitled in English. The ITV franchise in the north of Scotland, STV North (formerly Grampian Television) produces some non-news programming in Scottish Gaelic.\n\nEducation[edit]\nScotland[edit]\nMain article: Scottish Gaelic medium education\n Sgoil Gh\u00e0idhlig Ghlaschu (Glasgow Gaelic School)\n\n\nYear\nNumber ofstudents in Gaelic mediumeducation\nPercentageof all studentsin Scotland\n\n\n2005\n2,480\n0.35%\n\n\n2006\n2,535\n0.36%[71]\n\n\n2007\n2,601\n0.38%\n\n\n2008\n2,766\n0.40%[72]\n\n\n2009\n2,638\n0.39%[73]\n\n\n2010\n2,647\n0.39%[74]\n\n\n2011\n2,929\n0.44%[75]\n\n\n2012\n2,871\n0.43%[76]\n\n\n2013\n2,953\n0.44%[77]\n\n\n2014\n3,583\n0.53%[78]\n\n\n2015\n3,660\n0.54%[79]\n\n\n2016\n3,892\n0.57%[80]\n\n\n2017\n3,965\n0.58%[81]\n\n\n2018\n4,343\n0.63%[82]\n\n\n2019\n4,631\n0.66%\n\n\n2020\n4,849\n0.69%\n\nThe Education (Scotland) Act 1872, which completely ignored Gaelic and led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living in 2001 could recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school.[83] Even later, when these attitudes had changed, little provision was made for Gaelic medium education in Scottish schools. As late as 1958, even in Highland schools, only 20% of primary students were taught Gaelic as a subject, and only 5% were taught other subjects through the Gaelic language.[45]\nGaelic-medium playgroups for young children began to appear in Scotland during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Parent enthusiasm may have been a factor in the \"establishment of the first Gaelic medium primary school units in Glasgow and Inverness in 1985\".[84]\nThe first modern solely Gaelic-medium secondary school, Sgoil Gh\u00e0idhlig Ghlaschu (\"Glasgow Gaelic School\"), was opened at Woodside in Glasgow in 2006 (61 partially Gaelic-medium primary schools and approximately a dozen Gaelic-medium secondary schools also exist). According to B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig, a total of 2,092 primary pupils were enrolled in Gaelic-medium primary education in 2008\u201309, as opposed to 24 in 1985.[85]\nThe Columba Initiative, also known as colmcille (formerly Iomairt Cholm Cille), is a body that seeks to promote links between speakers of Scottish Gaelic and Irish.\nIn November 2019, the language-learning app Duolingo opened a beta course in Gaelic.[86][87][88]\nStarting from summer 2020, children starting school in the Western Isles will be enrolled in GME (Gaelic-medium education) unless parents request differently. Children will be taught Scottish Gaelic from P1 to P4 and then English will be introduced to give them a bilingual education.[89]\n\nCanada[edit]\nIn May 2004, the Nova Scotia government announced the funding of an initiative to support the language and its culture within the province. Several public schools in Northeastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton offer Gaelic classes as part of the high-school curriculum.[90]\nMaxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly. In Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School offer an introductory and an advanced course in Scottish Gaelic.[91]\n\nHigher and further education[edit]\nA number of Scottish and some Irish universities offer full-time degrees including a Gaelic language element, usually graduating as Celtic Studies.\nIn Nova Scotia, Canada, St. Francis Xavier University, the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and Cape Breton University (formerly known as the \"University College of Cape Breton\") offer Celtic Studies degrees and/or Gaelic language programs. The government's Office of Gaelic Affairs offers lunch-time lessons to public servants in Halifax.\nIn Russia the Moscow State University offers Gaelic language, history and culture courses.\nThe University of the Highlands and Islands offers a range of Gaelic language, history and culture courses at the National Certificate, Higher National Diploma, Bachelor of Arts (ordinary), Bachelor of Arts (Honours) and Master of Science levels. It offers opportunities for postgraduate research through the medium of Gaelic. Residential courses at Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig on the Isle of Skye offer adults the chance to become fluent in Gaelic in one year. Many continue to complete degrees, or to follow up as distance learners. A number of other colleges offer a one-year certificate course, which is also available online (pending accreditation).\nLews Castle College's Benbecula campus offers an independent 1-year course in Gaelic and Traditional Music (FE, SQF level 5/6).\n\nChurch[edit]\n A sign indicating services in Gaelic and English at a Free Church of Scotland congregation in the community of Ness, Isle of Lewis\nIn the Western Isles, the isles of Lewis, Harris and North Uist have a Presbyterian majority (largely Church of Scotland \u2013 Eaglais na h-Alba in Gaelic, Free Church of Scotland and Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland). The isles of South Uist and Barra have a Catholic majority. All these churches have Gaelic-speaking congregations throughout the Western Isles. Notable city congregations with regular services in Gaelic are St Columba's Church, Glasgow and Greyfriars Tolbooth & Highland Kirk, Edinburgh. Leabhar Sheirbheisean\u2014a shorter Gaelic version of the English-language Book of Common Order\u2014was published in 1996 by the Church of Scotland.\nThe widespread use of English in worship has often been suggested as one of the historic reasons for the decline of Gaelic. The Church of Scotland is supportive today,[vague] but has a shortage of Gaelic-speaking ministers. The Free Church also recently announced plans to abolish Gaelic-language communion services, citing both a lack of ministers and a desire to have their congregations united at communion time.[92]\n\nLiterature[edit]\nMain article: Scottish Gaelic literature\nFrom the sixth century to the present day, Scottish Gaelic has been used as the language of literature. Two prominent writers of the twentieth century are Anne Frater and Sorley Maclean.\n\nNames[edit]\nMain article: Scottish Gaelic name\nPersonal names[edit]\nGaelic has its own version of European-wide names which also have English forms, for example: Iain (John), Alasdair (Alexander), Uilleam (William), Catr\u00econa (Catherine), Raibeart (Robert), Cairist\u00econa (Christina), Anna (Ann), M\u00e0iri (Mary), Seumas (James), P\u00e0draig (Patrick) and T\u00f2mas (Thomas).\nNot all traditional Gaelic names have direct equivalents in English: Oighrig, which is normally rendered as Euphemia (Effie) or Henrietta (Etta) (formerly also as Henny or even as Harriet), or, Diorbhal, which is \"matched\" with Dorothy, simply on the basis of a certain similarity in spelling. Many of these traditional Gaelic-only names are now regarded as old-fashioned, and hence are rarely or never used.\nSome names have come into Gaelic from Old Norse; for example, Somhairle ( < Somarli\u00f0r), Tormod (< \u00de\u00f3rm\u00f3\u00f0r), Raghnall or Raonull (< R\u01ebgnvaldr), Torcuil (< \u00de\u00f3rkell, \u00de\u00f3rketill), \u00ccomhar (\u00cdvarr). These are conventionally rendered in English as Sorley (or, historically, Somerled), Norman, Ronald or Ranald, Torquil and Iver (or Evander).\nSome Scottish names are Anglicized forms of Gaelic names: Aonghas \u2192 (Angus), D\u00f2mhnall\u2192 (Donald), for instance. Hamish, and the recently established Mhairi (pronounced [va\u02d0ri]) come from the Gaelic for, respectively, James, and Mary, but derive from the form of the names as they appear in the vocative case: Seumas (James) (nom.) \u2192 Sheumais (voc.) and M\u00e0iri (Mary) (nom.) \u2192 Mh\u00e0iri (voc.).\n\nSurnames[edit]\nThe most common class of Gaelic surnames are those beginning with mac (Gaelic for \"son\"), such as MacGillEathain\u2009/\u2009MacIllEathain[93][94] (MacLean). The female form is nic (Gaelic for \"daughter\"), so Catherine MacPhee is properly called in Gaelic, Catr\u00econa Nic a' Ph\u00ec[95] (strictly, nic is a contraction of the Gaelic phrase nighean mhic, meaning \"daughter of the son\", thus NicDh\u00f2mhnaill[94] really means \"daughter of MacDonald\" rather than \"daughter of Donald\"). The \"of\" part actually comes from the genitive form of the patronymic that follows the prefix; in the case of MacDh\u00f2mhnaill, Dh\u00f2mhnaill (\"of Donald\") is the genitive form of D\u00f2mhnall (\"Donald\").[96]\nSeveral colours give rise to common Scottish surnames: b\u00e0n (Bain \u2013 white), ruadh (Roy \u2013 red), dubh (Dow, Duff \u2013 black), donn (Dunn \u2013 brown), buidhe (Bowie \u2013 yellow) although in Gaelic these occur as part of a fuller form such as MacGille 'son of the servant of', i.e. MacGilleBh\u00e0in, MacGilleRuaidh, MacGilleDhuibh, MacGilleDhuinn, MacGilleBhuidhe.\n\nPhonology[edit]\nMain article: Scottish Gaelic phonology\nMost varieties of Gaelic show either eight or nine vowel qualities (/i e \u025b a \u0254 o u \u0264 \u026f/) in their inventory of vowel phonemes, which can be either long or short. There are also two reduced vowels ([\u0259 \u026a]) which only occur short. Although some vowels are strongly nasal, instances of distinctive nasality are rare. There are about nine diphthongs and a few triphthongs.\nMost consonants have both palatal and non-palatal counterparts, including a very rich system of liquids, nasals and trills (i.e. three contrasting \"l\" sounds, three contrasting \"n\" sounds and three contrasting \"r\" sounds). The historically voiced stops [b d\u032a \u0261] have lost their voicing, so the phonemic contrast today is between unaspirated [p t\u032a k] and aspirated [p\u02b0 t\u032a\u02b0 k\u02b0]. In many dialects, these stops may however gain voicing through secondary articulation through a preceding nasal, for examples doras [t\u032a\u0254\u027e\u0259s\u032a] \"door\" but an doras \"the door\" as [\u0259n\u032a\u02e0 d\u032a\u0254\u027e\u0259s\u032a] or [\u0259 n\u032a\u02e0\u0254\u027e\u0259s\u032a].\nIn some fixed phrases, these changes are shown permanently, as the link with the base words has been lost, as in an-dr\u00e0sta \"now\", from an tr\u00e0th-sa \"this time/period\".\nIn medial and final position, the aspirated stops are preaspirated rather than postaspirated.\n\nGrammar[edit]\nMain article: Scottish Gaelic grammar\nScottish Gaelic is an Indo-European language with an inflecting morphology, verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order and two grammatical genders.\n\nNoun inflection[edit]\nGaelic nouns inflect for four cases (nominative/accusative, vocative, genitive and dative) and three numbers (singular, dual and plural).\nThey are also normally classed as either masculine or feminine. A small number of words that used to belong to the neuter class show some degree of gender confusion. For example, in some dialects am muir \"the sea\" behaves as a masculine noun in the nominative case, but as a feminine noun in the genitive (na mara).\nNouns are marked for case in a number of ways, most commonly involving various combinations of lenition, palatalisation and suffixation.\n\nVerb inflection[edit]\nThere are 12 irregular verbs.[97] Most other verbs follow a fully predictable paradigm, although polysyllabic verbs ending in laterals can deviate from this paradigm as they show syncopation.\nThere are:\n\nThree persons: 1st, 2nd and 3rd\nTwo numbers: singular and plural\nTwo voices: traditionally called active and passive, but actually personal and impersonal\nThree non-composed combined TAM forms expressing tense, aspect and mood, i.e. non-past (future-habitual), conditional (future of the past), and past (preterite); several composed TAM forms, such as pluperfect, future perfect, present perfect, present continuous, past continuous, conditional perfect, etc. Two verbs, bi, used to attribute a notionally temporary state, action, or quality to the subject, and is (a defective verb that has only two forms), used to show a notional permanent identity or quality, have non-composed present and non-past tense forms: (bi) tha [perfective present], bidh/bithidh [imperfective non-past][94] and all other especeted verb forms, though the verb adjective (\"past participle\") is lacking; (is) is, bu past and conditional.\nFour moods: independent (used in affirmative main clause verbs), relative (used in verbs in affirmative relative clauses), dependent (used in subordinate clauses, anti-affirmative relative clauses, and anti-affirmative main clauses), and subjunctive.\nWord order[edit]\nWord order is strictly verb\u2013subject\u2013object, including questions, negative questions and negatives. Only a restricted set of preverb particles may occur before the verb.\n\nLexicon[edit]\nThe majority of the vocabulary of Scottish Gaelic is of Celtic origin. There are a large number of borrowings from Latin (muinntir, Did\u00f2mhnaich from (dies) dominica), Norse (eilean from eyland, sgeir from sker), French (se\u00f2mar from chambre) and Scots (aidh, bramar).[citation needed]\nThere are also many Brythonic influences on Scottish Gaelic. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However, some common words such as monadh = Welsh mynydd, Cumbric *monidh are clearly of P-Celtic origin.[98]\nIn common with other Indo-European languages, the neologisms coined for modern concepts are typically based on Greek or Latin, although often coming through English; television, for instance, becomes telebhisean and computer becomes coimpi\u00f9tar. Some speakers use an English word even if there is a Gaelic equivalent, applying the rules of Gaelic grammar. With verbs, for instance, they will simply add the verbal suffix (-eadh, or, in Lewis, -igeadh, as in, \"Tha mi a' watch eadh (Lewis, \"watch igeadh\") an telly\" (I am watching the television), instead of \"Tha mi a' coimhead air an telebhisean\". This phenomenon was described over 170 years ago, by the minister who compiled the account covering the parish of Stornoway in the New Statistical Account of Scotland, and examples can be found dating to the eighteenth century.[99] However, as Gaelic medium education grows in popularity, a newer generation of literate Gaels has become more familiar with modern Gaelic vocabulary.[citation needed]\n\nLoanwords into other languages[edit]\nScottish Gaelic has also influenced the Scots language and English, particularly Scottish Standard English. Loanwords include: whisky, slogan, brogue, jilt, clan, trousers, gob, as well as familiar elements of Scottish geography like ben (beinn), glen (gleann) and loch. Irish has also influenced Lowland Scots and English in Scotland, but it is not always easy to distinguish its influence from that of Scottish Gaelic.[100][page\u00a0needed]\n\nOrthography[edit]\nMain article: Scottish Gaelic orthography\n Gaelic public signage has become more common in the Scottish Highlands. This sign is located in the bilingual port community of Mallaig.\nScottish Gaelic orthography is very regular; its standard was set by the 1767 New Testament. The 1981 Scottish Examination Board recommendations for Scottish Gaelic, the Gaelic Orthographic Conventions, were adopted by most publishers and agencies, although they remain controversial among some academics, most notably Ronald Black.[101]\nThe quality of consonants (broad or slender) is indicated by the vowels surrounding them. Slender (palatalised) consonants are surrounded by slender vowels (\u27e8e, i\u27e9), while broad (neutral or velarised) consonants are surrounded by broad vowels (\u27e8a, o, u\u27e9). The spelling rule known as caol ri caol agus leathann ri leathann (\"slender to slender and broad to broad\") requires that a word-medial consonant or consonant group followed by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 and similarly, if followed by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9.\nThis rule sometimes leads to the insertion of a silent written vowel. For example, plurals in Gaelic are often formed with the suffix -an [\u0259n], for example, br\u00f2g [pr\u0254\u02d0k] (\"shoe\") / br\u00f2gan [pr\u0254\u02d0k\u0259n] (\"shoes\"). But because of the spelling rule, the suffix is spelled -ean (but pronounced the same, [\u0259n]) after a slender consonant, as in muinntir [m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2] (\"[a] people\") / muinntirean [m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2\u0259n] (\"peoples\") where \u27e8e\u27e9 is purely a graphic vowel inserted to conform with the spelling rule because \u27e8i\u27e9 precedes the \u27e8r\u27e9.\nUnstressed vowels omitted in speech can be omitted in informal writing, e.g. Tha mi an d\u00f2chas. (\"I hope.\") > Tha mi 'n d\u00f2chas.\nScots English orthographic rules have also been used at various times in Gaelic writing. Notable examples of Gaelic verse composed in this manner are the Book of the Dean of Lismore and the Fernaig manuscript.\n\nAlphabet[edit]\nFurther information: Scottish Gaelic orthography \u00a7\u00a0Alphabet\nThe modern Scottish Gaelic alphabet has 18 letters: \u27e8a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u\u27e9. \u27e8h\u27e9 is mostly used to indicate lenition of a consonant, it was not used in older writings, since lenition was indicated by an overdot. The letters of the alphabet were traditionally named after trees, but this custom has fallen out of use.\nLong vowels are marked with a grave accent (\u27e8\u00e0, \u00e8, \u00ec, \u00f2, \u00f9\u27e9), indicated through digraphs (e.g. \u27e8ao\u27e9 for [\u026f\u02d0]) or conditioned by certain consonant environments (e.g. \u27e8u\u27e9 preceding a non-intervocalic \u27e8nn\u27e9 is [u\u02d0]). Traditionally the acute accent was used on \u27e8\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00f3\u27e9 to represent long close-mid vowels, but the spelling reforms replaced it with the grave accent.[94]\nCertain 18th century sources used only an acute accent along the lines of Irish, such as in the writings of Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (1741\u201351) and the earliest editions (1768\u201390) of Duncan Ban MacIntyre.[102]\n\nExample text[edit]\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Scottish Gaelic: \n\nRugadh na h-uile duine saor agus co-ionnan nan urram 's nan c\u00f2irichean.

(listen)), also known as Scots Gaelic and Gaelic, is a Goidelic language (in the Celtic branch of the Indo-European language family) native to the Gaels of Scotland. As a Goidelic language, Scottish Gaelic, as well as both Irish and Manx, developed out of Old Irish.[4] It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period, although a common literary language was shared by Gaels in both Ireland and Scotland down to the 16th century.[5] Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language place names.[6][7]\nScottish GaelicScottish GaelicG\u00e0idhlig[\u02c8ka\u02d0l\u026ak\u02b2][\u02c8ka\u02d0l\u026ak\u02b2](listen)listenlistenlistenScots GaelicGaelicGoidelic languageCelticIndo-EuropeanGaelsScotlandIrishManxOld Irish[4][4]spoken languageMiddle Irishcommonliterary languageIreland[5][5][6][6][7][7]In the 2011 census of Scotland, 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over 3 years old) reported being able to speak Gaelic, 1,275 fewer than in 2001. The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, there are revival efforts, and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.[8] Outside Scotland, a dialect known as Canadian Gaelic has been spoken in eastern Canada since the 18th century. In the 2016 national census, nearly 4,000 Canadian residents claimed knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, with a particular concentration in Nova Scotia.[9][10]\n2011 census of ScotlandOuter Hebrides[8][8]Canadian Gaeliceastern CanadaCanadianNova Scotia[9][9][10][10]Scottish Gaelic is not an official language of the United Kingdom.

Prior to the 15th century, this language was known as Inglis (\"English\")[13] by its own speakers, with Gaelic being called Scottis (\"Scottish\"). Beginning in the late 15th century, it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as Erse (\"Irish\") and the Lowland vernacular as Scottis.[14] Today, Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish, so the word Erse in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used.[15]\nScotsMiddle EnglishLowlands of ScotlandInglis[13][13]ScottisErseScottis[14][14]Erse[15][15]History[edit]History[edit][edit]Main articles: History of the Irish language and History of Scottish GaelicHistory of the Irish languageHistory of Scottish GaelicOrigins[edit]Origins[edit][edit]Further information: History of the Irish language, Primitive Irish, Old Irish, Middle Irish, and Early Modern IrishHistory of the Irish languagePrimitive IrishOld IrishMiddle IrishEarly Modern Irish Place names in Scotland that contain the element bal- from the Scottish Gaelic baile meaning home, farmstead, town or city.

These data give some indication of the extent of medieval Gaelic settlement in Scotland.bal-bailebaileBased on medieval traditional accounts and the apparent evidence from linguistic geography, Gaelic has been commonly believed to have been brought to Scotland, in the 4th\u20135th centuries CE, by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata on Scotland's west coast in present-day Argyll.[16]:\u200a551\u200a[17]:\u200a66\u200a An alternative view has been voiced by archaeologist Dr Ewan Campbell, who has argued that the putative migration or takeover is not reflected in archaeological or placename data (as pointed out earlier by Leslie Alcock). Campbell has also questioned the age and reliability of the medieval historical sources speaking of a conquest. Instead, he has inferred that Argyll formed part of a common Q-Celtic-speaking area with Ireland, connected rather than divided by the sea, since the Iron Age.[18] These arguments have been opposed by some scholars defending the early dating of the traditional accounts and arguing for other interpretations of the archaeological evidence.[19]\nD\u00e1l RiataD\u00e1l RiataD\u00e1l RiataArgyll[16][16]:\u200a551\u200a:\u200a551\u200a[17][17]:\u200a66\u200a:\u200a66\u200aEwan CampbellLeslie AlcockQ-Celtic[18][18][19][19]Regardless of how it came to be spoken in the region, Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to D\u00e1l Riata until the eighth century, when it began expanding into Pictish areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. During the reign of Caustant\u00edn mac \u00c1eda (Constantine II, 900\u2013943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than as the kingdom of the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of Caustant\u00edn and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten.[20]  Bilingualism in Pictish and Gaelic, prior to the former's extinction, led to the presence of Pictish loanwords in Gaelic[21] and syntactic influence[22]  which could be considered to constitute a Pictish substrate.[23]\nD\u00e1l RiataD\u00e1l RiataPictishCaustant\u00edn mac \u00c1edaCaustant\u00edn mac \u00c1edaCaustant\u00edn mac \u00c1edaGaelicisationCaustant\u00ednCaustant\u00edn[20][20]loanwords[21][21][22][22][23][23]In 1018, after the conquest of the Lothians by the Kingdom of Scotland, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith.[24]:\u200a16\u201318\u200a Colloquial speech in Scotland had been developing independently of that in Ireland since the eighth century.[25] For the first time, the entire region of modern-day Scotland was called Scotia in Latin, and Gaelic was the lingua Scotica.[26]:\u200a276\u200a[27]:\u200a554\u200a In southern Scotland, Gaelic was strong in Galloway, adjoining areas to the north and west, West Lothian, and parts of western Midlothian. It was spoken to a lesser degree in north Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, the Clyde Valley and eastern Dumfriesshire.

He was the last Scottish monarch to be buried on Iona, the traditional burial place of the Gaelic Kings of D\u00e0l Riada and the Kingdom of Alba.[citation needed] However, during the reigns of Malcolm Canmore's sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I (their successive reigns lasting 1097\u20131153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth\u2013Clyde line and along the northeastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under David I, attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking Old English. This was the beginning of Gaelic's status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.[24]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a\nMalcolm IIIMargaret of Wessex[24][24]:\u200a19\u200a:\u200a19\u200aDonald III[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededthoroughly Gaelic westIonaD\u00e0l RiadaD\u00e0l Riada[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededAnglo-NormanDavid I[24][24]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a:\u200a19\u201323\u200aClan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there.

For example, the nation's great patriotic literature including John Barbour's The Brus (1375) and Blind Harry's The Wallace (before 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. By the end of the 15th century, English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as 'Yrisch' or 'Erse', i.e. Irish and their own language as 'Scottis'.[24]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a\nScotsInglis[29][29]:\u200a139\u200a:\u200a139\u200aWars of Scottish IndependenceThe BrusThe BrusThe WallaceThe Wallace[24][24]:\u200a19\u201323\u200a:\u200a19\u201323\u200aModern era[edit]Modern era[edit][edit]A steady shift away from Scottish Gaelic continued into and through the modern era. Some of this was driven by policy decisions by government or other organisations, some originated from social changes. In the last quarter of the 20th century, efforts began to encourage use of the language.\nThe Statutes of Iona, enacted by James VI in 1609, was one piece of legislation that addressed, among other things, the Gaelic language. It compelled the heirs of clan chiefs to be educated in lowland, Protestant, English-speaking schools. James VI took several such measures to impose his rule on the Highland and Island region. In 1616 the Privy Council proclaimed that schools teaching in English should be established. Gaelic was seen, at this time, as one of the causes of the instability of the region. It was also associated with Catholicism.[30]:\u200a110\u2013113\u200a\nStatutes of IonaJames VIPrivy Council[30][30]:\u200a110\u2013113\u200a:\u200a110\u2013113\u200aThe Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was founded in 1709. They met in 1716, immediately after the failed Jacobite rebellion of 1715, to consider the reform and civilisation of the Highlands, which they sought to achieve by teaching English and the Protestant religion. Initially their teaching was entirely in English, but soon the impracticality of educating Gaelic-speaking children in this way gave rise to a modest concession: in 1723 teachers were allowed to translate English words in the Bible into Gaelic to aid comprehension, but there was no further permitted use. Other less prominent schools worked in the Highlands at the same time, also teaching in English. This process of anglicisation paused when evangelical preachers arrived in the Highlands, convinced that people should be able to read religious texts in their own language. The first well-known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767 when Dr James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. In 1798 4 tracts in Gaelic were published by the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home. 5,000 copies of each were printed. Other publications followed, with a full Gaelic Bible in 1801. The influential and effective Gaelic Schools Society was founded in 1811. Their purpose was to teach Gaels to read the Bible in their own language. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the SSPCK (despite their anti-Gaelic attitude in prior years) and the British and Foreign Bible Society distributed 60,000 Gaelic Bibles and 80,000 New Testaments.[31]:\u200a98\u200a It is estimated that this overall schooling and publishing effort gave some 300,000 people in the Highlands some basic literacy.[30]:\u200a110\u2013117\u200a Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible; the lack of a well-known translation may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic.[32]:\u200a168\u2013202\u200a\nSociety in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian KnowledgeBibleDugald BuchananRannoch[31][31]:\u200a98\u200a:\u200a98\u200a[30][30]:\u200a110\u2013117\u200a:\u200a110\u2013117\u200a[32][32]:\u200a168\u2013202\u200a:\u200a168\u2013202\u200a 1891 distribution of English (including Scots) and Gaelic in Scotland  \u00a0\u00a075\u201380% Gaelic, and English \u2501\u00a025\u201375% Gaelic, and English; line indicates the 50% isogloss  \u00a0\u00a05\u201325% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a00\u20135% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a0Purely English 1891 distribution of English (including Scots) and Gaelic in Scotland  \u00a0\u00a075\u201380% Gaelic, and English \u2501\u00a025\u201375% Gaelic, and English; line indicates the 50% isogloss  \u00a0\u00a05\u201325% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a00\u20135% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a0Purely English1891 distribution of English (including Scots) and Gaelic in Scotland  \u00a0\u00a075\u201380% Gaelic, and English \u2501\u00a025\u201375% Gaelic, and English; line indicates the 50% isogloss  \u00a0\u00a05\u201325% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a00\u20135% Gaelic, and English \u00a0\u00a0Purely EnglishEnglishScots\u00a0\u00a075\u201380% Gaelic, and English\u00a0\u2501\u00a025\u201375% Gaelic, and English; line indicates the 50% isogloss \u2501\u2501\u2501isogloss\u00a0\u00a05\u201325% Gaelic, and English\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u20135% Gaelic, and English\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Purely English\u00a0Counterintuitively, access to schooling in Gaelic increased knowledge of English. In 1829 the Gaelic Schools Society reported that parents were unconcerned about their children learning Gaelic, but were anxious to have them taught English. The SSPCK also found Highlanders to have significant prejudice against Gaelic. T. M. Devine attributes this to an association between English and the prosperity of employment: the Highland economy relied greatly on seasonal migrant workers travelling outside the G\u00e0idhealtachd. In 1863, an observer sympathetic to Gaelic stated that \"knowledge of English is indispensable to any poor islander who wishes to learn a trade or to earn his bread beyond the limits of his native Isle\". Generally, rather than Gaelic speakers, it was Celtic societies in the cities and professors of Celtic from universities who sought to preserve the language.[30]:\u200a116\u2013117\u200a\nG\u00e0idhealtachdG\u00e0idhealtachd[30][30]:\u200a116\u2013117\u200a:\u200a116\u2013117\u200aThe Education (Scotland) Act 1872 provided universal education in Scotland, but completely ignored Gaelic in its plans. The mechanism for supporting Gaelic through the Education Codes issued by the Scottish Education Department were steadily used to overcome this omission, with many concessions in place by 1918. However, the members of Highland school boards tended to have anti-Gaelic attitudes and served as an obstacle to Gaelic education in the late 19th and early 20th century.[30]:\u200a110\u2013111\u200a\nEducation (Scotland) Act 1872[30][30]:\u200a110\u2013111\u200a:\u200a110\u2013111\u200aThe Linguistic Survey of Scotland surveyed both the dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language, and also mixed use of English and Gaelic across the Highlands and Islands.[33]\nLinguistic Survey of Scotland[33][33]Defunct dialects[edit]Defunct dialects[edit][edit]Dialects of Lowland Gaelic have been defunct since the 18th century. Gaelic in the Eastern and Southern Scottish Highlands, although alive until the mid-20th century, is now largely defunct. Although modern Scottish Gaelic is dominated by the dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye, there remain some speakers of the Inner Hebridean dialects of Tiree and Islay, and even a few native speakers from Western Highland areas including Wester Ross, northwest Sutherland, Lochaber and Argyll. Dialects on both sides of the Straits of Moyle (the North Channel) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the Mull of Kintyre, on Rathlin and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary.[34] Some features of moribund dialects have been preserved in Nova Scotia, including the pronunciation of the broad or velarised l (l\u032a\u02e0) as [w], as in the Lochaber dialect.[35]:\u200a131\u200a\nWester RossSutherlandLochaberArgyllStraits of MoyleNorth ChannelMull of KintyreRathlin[34][34]velarisedl\u032a\u02e0[w]Lochaber[35][35]:\u200a131\u200a:\u200a131\u200aStatus[edit]Status[edit][edit]\n.mw-parser-output .ambox{border:1px solid #a2a9b1;border-left:10px solid #36c;background-color:#fbfbfb;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+link+.ambox{margin-top:-1px}html body.mediawiki .mw-parser-output .ambox.mbox-small-left{margin:4px 1em 4px 0;overflow:hidden;width:238px;border-collapse:collapse;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em}.mw-parser-output .ambox-speedy{border-left:10px solid #b32424;background-color:#fee7e6}.mw-parser-output .ambox-delete{border-left:10px solid #b32424}.mw-parser-output .ambox-content{border-left:10px solid #f28500}.mw-parser-output .ambox-style{border-left:10px solid #fc3}.mw-parser-output .ambox-move{border-left:10px solid #9932cc}.mw-parser-output .ambox-protection{border-left:10px solid #a2a9b1}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-text{border:none;padding:0.25em 0.5em;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image{border:none;padding:2px 0 2px 0.5em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-imageright{border:none;padding:2px 0.5em 2px 0;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-empty-cell{border:none;padding:0;width:1px}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image-div{width:52px}html.client-js body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .mbox-text-span{margin-left:23px!important}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .ambox{margin:0 10%}}This section needs expansion with: preservation and revitalization efforts; Canadian Gaelic stats.

Gaelic, along with Irish and Welsh, is designated under Part III of the Charter, which requires the UK Government to take a range of concrete measures in the fields of education, justice, public administration, broadcasting and culture. It has not received the same degree of official recognition from the UK Government as Welsh. With the advent of devolution, however, Scottish matters have begun to receive greater attention, and it achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament on 21 April 2005.\nEuropean Charter for Regional or Minority LanguagesWelshdevolutionGaelic Language (Scotland) ActScottish ParliamentThe key provisions of the Act are:[47]\n[47][47]Establishing the Gaelic development body, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig (BnG), on a statutory basis with a view to securing the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland commanding equal respect to the English language and to promote the use and understanding of Gaelic.\nRequiring BnG to prepare a National Gaelic Language Plan every five years for approval by Scottish Ministers.\nRequiring BnG to produce guidance on Gaelic medium education and Gaelic as a subject for education authorities.\nRequiring public bodies in Scotland, both Scottish public bodies and cross-border public bodies insofar as they carry out devolved functions, to develop Gaelic language plans in relation to the services they offer, if requested to do so by BnG.Establishing the Gaelic development body, B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig (BnG), on a statutory basis with a view to securing the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland commanding equal respect to the English language and to promote the use and understanding of Gaelic.B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhligB\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhligB\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhligRequiring BnG to prepare a National Gaelic Language Plan every five years for approval by Scottish Ministers.Requiring BnG to produce guidance on Gaelic medium education and Gaelic as a subject for education authorities.Gaelic medium educationRequiring public bodies in Scotland, both Scottish public bodies and cross-border public bodies insofar as they carry out devolved functions, to develop Gaelic language plans in relation to the services they offer, if requested to do so by BnG.Following a consultation period, in which the government received many submissions, the majority of which asked that the bill be strengthened, a revised bill was published; the main alteration was that the guidance of the B\u00f2rd is now statutory (rather than advisory). In the committee stages in the Scottish Parliament, there was much debate over whether Gaelic should be given 'equal validity' with English. Due to executive concerns about resourcing implications if this wording was used, the Education Committee settled on the concept of 'equal respect'. It is not clear what the legal force of this wording is.\nB\u00f2rdB\u00f2rdThe Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament unanimously, with support from all sectors of the Scottish political spectrum, on 21 April 2005.

This did not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU but gave it the right to be a means of formal communications in the EU's institutions. The Scottish government had to pay for the translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government's support for Gaelic. He said; \"Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed\".[citation needed] Culture Minister Mike Russell said; \"this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad and I look forward to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon.

The \"of\" part actually comes from the genitive form of the patronymic that follows the prefix; in the case of MacDh\u00f2mhnaill, Dh\u00f2mhnaill (\"of Donald\") is the genitive form of D\u00f2mhnall (\"Donald\").[96]\nmacmacmacMacGillEathainMacGillEathainMacIllEathainMacIllEathain[93][93][94][94]nicnicCatr\u00econa Nic a' Ph\u00ecCatr\u00econa Nic a' Ph\u00ec[95][95]nicnicnighean mhicnighean mhicNicDh\u00f2mhnaillNicDh\u00f2mhnaill[94][94]MacDh\u00f2mhnaillMacDh\u00f2mhnaillDh\u00f2mhnaillDh\u00f2mhnaillD\u00f2mhnallD\u00f2mhnall[96][96]Several colours give rise to common Scottish surnames: b\u00e0n (Bain \u2013 white), ruadh (Roy \u2013 red), dubh (Dow, Duff \u2013 black), donn (Dunn \u2013 brown), buidhe (Bowie \u2013 yellow) although in Gaelic these occur as part of a fuller form such as MacGille 'son of the servant of', i.e. MacGilleBh\u00e0in, MacGilleRuaidh, MacGilleDhuibh, MacGilleDhuinn, MacGilleBhuidhe.\nb\u00e0nb\u00e0nBainruadhruadhdubhdubhDuffdonndonnDunnbuidhebuidheBowieMacGilleMacGilleMacGilleBh\u00e0in, MacGilleRuaidh, MacGilleDhuibh, MacGilleDhuinn, MacGilleBhuidheMacGilleBh\u00e0in, MacGilleRuaidh, MacGilleDhuibh, MacGilleDhuinn, MacGilleBhuidhePhonology[edit]Phonology[edit][edit]Main article: Scottish Gaelic phonologyScottish Gaelic phonologyMost varieties of Gaelic show either eight or nine vowel qualities (/i e \u025b a \u0254 o u \u0264 \u026f/) in their inventory of vowel phonemes, which can be either long or short.

There are a large number of borrowings from Latin (muinntir, Did\u00f2mhnaich from (dies) dominica), Norse (eilean from eyland, sgeir from sker), French (se\u00f2mar from chambre) and Scots (aidh, bramar).[citation needed]\nCelticLatinmuinntirmuinntirDid\u00f2mhnaichDid\u00f2mhnaich(dies) dominica(dies) dominicaeileaneileaneylandeylandsgeirsgeirskerskerFrenchse\u00f2marse\u00f2marchambrechambreScotsaidhaidhbramarbramar[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededThere are also many Brythonic influences on Scottish Gaelic. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However, some common words such as monadh = Welsh mynydd, Cumbric *monidh are clearly of P-Celtic origin.[98]\nmonadhmonadhmynyddmynydd*monidhmonidh[98][98]In common with other Indo-European languages, the neologisms coined for modern concepts are typically based on Greek or Latin, although often coming through English; television, for instance, becomes telebhisean and computer becomes coimpi\u00f9tar. Some speakers use an English word even if there is a Gaelic equivalent, applying the rules of Gaelic grammar. With verbs, for instance, they will simply add the verbal suffix (-eadh, or, in Lewis, -igeadh, as in, \"Tha mi a' watch eadh (Lewis, \"watch igeadh\") an telly\" (I am watching the television), instead of \"Tha mi a' coimhead air an telebhisean\". This phenomenon was described over 170 years ago, by the minister who compiled the account covering the parish of Stornoway in the New Statistical Account of Scotland, and examples can be found dating to the eighteenth century.[99] However, as Gaelic medium education grows in popularity, a newer generation of literate Gaels has become more familiar with modern Gaelic vocabulary.[citation needed]\nIndo-European languagesneologismsGreekLatintelevisiontelebhiseantelebhiseancomputercoimpi\u00f9tarcoimpi\u00f9tar-eadh-eadhLewis-igeadh-igeadhTha mi a'Tha mi a'eadheadhigeadhigeadhananTha mi a' coimhead air an telebhiseanTha mi a' coimhead air an telebhiseanStornowayNew Statistical Account of Scotland[99][99][citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededLoanwords into other languages[edit]Loanwords into other languages[edit][edit]Scottish Gaelic has also influenced the Scots language and English, particularly Scottish Standard English. Loanwords include: whisky, slogan, brogue, jilt, clan, trousers, gob, as well as familiar elements of Scottish geography like ben (beinn), glen (gleann) and loch. Irish has also influenced Lowland Scots and English in Scotland, but it is not always easy to distinguish its influence from that of Scottish Gaelic.[100][page\u00a0needed]\nScots languageEnglishScottish Standard EnglishtrousersbeinnbeinngleanngleannlochlochlochIrish[100][100][page\u00a0needed]page\u00a0neededpage\u00a0neededpage\u00a0neededOrthography[edit]Orthography[edit][edit]Main article: Scottish Gaelic orthographyScottish Gaelic orthography Gaelic public signage has become more common in the Scottish Highlands.

The 1981 Scottish Examination Board recommendations for Scottish Gaelic, the Gaelic Orthographic Conventions, were adopted by most publishers and agencies, although they remain controversial among some academics, most notably Ronald Black.[101]\northographyNew TestamentScottish Examination Board[101][101]The quality of consonants (broad or slender) is indicated by the vowels surrounding them. Slender (palatalised) consonants are surrounded by slender vowels (\u27e8e, i\u27e9), while broad (neutral or velarised) consonants are surrounded by broad vowels (\u27e8a, o, u\u27e9). The spelling rule known as caol ri caol agus leathann ri leathann (\"slender to slender and broad to broad\") requires that a word-medial consonant or consonant group followed by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8i, e\u27e9 and similarly, if followed by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9 is preceded by \u27e8a, o, u\u27e9.\nvowelspalatalisedvelarisedcaol ri caol agus leathann ri leathanncaol ri caol agus leathann ri leathannThis rule sometimes leads to the insertion of a silent written vowel. For example, plurals in Gaelic are often formed with the suffix -an [\u0259n], for example, br\u00f2g [pr\u0254\u02d0k] (\"shoe\") / br\u00f2gan [pr\u0254\u02d0k\u0259n] (\"shoes\"). But because of the spelling rule, the suffix is spelled -ean (but pronounced the same, [\u0259n]) after a slender consonant, as in muinntir [m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2] (\"[a] people\") / muinntirean [m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2\u0259n] (\"peoples\") where \u27e8e\u27e9 is purely a graphic vowel inserted to conform with the spelling rule because \u27e8i\u27e9 precedes the \u27e8r\u27e9.\nsilent-an-an[\u0259n][\u0259n]br\u00f2gbr\u00f2g[pr\u0254\u02d0k]br\u00f2ganbr\u00f2gan[pr\u0254\u02d0k\u0259n]-ean-ean[\u0259n][\u0259n]muinntirmuinntir[m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2]muinntireanmuinntirean[m\u026fi\u032f\u0272t\u02b2\u026ar\u02b2\u0259n]Unstressed vowels omitted in speech can be omitted in informal writing, e.g. Tha mi an d\u00f2chas.

Kingdom\n\"Cathedral city\" redirects here. For other uses, see Cathedral city (disambiguation).\n\n\n Until the 19th century, city status in England and Wales was associated with the presence of a cathedral, such as York Minster.\nCity status in the United Kingdom is granted by the monarch of the United Kingdom to a select group of communities. As of 26\u00a0January\u00a02022[update],[1][2] there are 70 cities in the United Kingdom\u201452 in England,[3][4] six in Wales, seven in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.[5] Although it carries no special rights, the status of city can be a marker of prestige and confer local pride.[6]\nThe status does not apply automatically on the basis of any particular criterion, though in England and Wales it was traditionally given to towns with diocesan cathedrals. This association between having an Anglican cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when King Henry VIII founded dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and granted them city status by issuing letters patent.\nCity status in Ireland was granted to far fewer communities than in England and Wales, and there are only two pre-19th-century cities in present-day Northern Ireland. In Scotland, city status did not explicitly receive any recognition by the state until the 19th century. At that time, a revival of grants of city status took place, first in England, where the grants were accompanied by the establishment of new cathedrals, and later in Scotland and Ireland. In the 20th century, it was explicitly recognised that the status of city in England and Wales would no longer be bound to the presence of a cathedral, and grants made since have been awarded to communities on a variety of criteria, including population size.\nThe abolition of some corporate bodies as part of successive local-government reforms, beginning with the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, has deprived some ancient cities of their status. However, letters patent have been issued for most of the affected cities to ensure the continuation or restoration of their status. At present, Rochester and Elgin are the only former cities in the United Kingdom. The name \"City\" does not, in itself, denote city status; it may be appended to place names for historic association (e.g. White City) or for marketing or disambiguation (e.g. Stratford City). A number of large towns (such as those with over 200,000 residents) in the UK are bigger than some small cities, but cannot legitimately call themselves cities without the royal designation.[citation needed]\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n1.1 England and Wales\n\n1.1.1 Pre-19th century\n1.1.2 1836\u20131888\n1.1.3 1889\u20131907\n\n1.1.3.1 The status of Westminster\n\n\n1.1.4 1907\u20131953\n1.1.5 1953\u20131974\n1.1.6 1974 reorganisation and new cities\n1.1.7 2021 bids for city status\n1.1.8 Greater London\n1.1.9 Rochester\n\n\n1.2 Scotland\n1.3 Ireland and Northern Ireland\n1.4 Crown colonies and British Overseas Territories\n\n\n2 Current practice of granting city status\n\n2.1 Lord mayors\n2.2 Local government districts\n2.3 City councils\n\n2.3.1 England\n2.3.2 Scotland\n2.3.3 Wales\n2.3.4 Northern Ireland\n\n\n2.4 City status conferment\n\n\n3 Officially designated cities\n\n3.1 List of officially designated cities\n\n3.1.1 England\n3.1.2 Scotland\n3.1.3 Wales\n3.1.4 Northern Ireland\n\n\n3.2 Future UK cities\n\n\n4 Smallest and largest cities\n\n4.1 Smallest\n4.2 Largest\n\n\n5 Towns not cities\n\n5.1 Populous towns\n5.2 Cathedral towns\n\n5.2.1 England and Wales\n5.2.2 Scotland\n5.2.3 Northern Ireland\n\n\n5.3 Claimants\n\n5.3.1 Future cities\n\n\n\n\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nEngland and Wales[edit]\nPre-19th century[edit]\nThe initial cities (Latin: civitas) of Britain were the fortified settlements organised by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the \"28 Cities\" (Old Welsh: cair) which was mentioned by Gildas[8] and listed by Nennius.[9]\nIn the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city by the English Crown if it had a diocesan cathedral within its limits, for which 22 dioceses existed in England & Wales (see City status conferment further in the article). This association between having a cathedral and being called a city was established when Henry VIII founded new dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and also granted them city status by issuing letters patent,[10] demonstrating these were discrete procedures. Some cities today are very small because they were granted city status in or before the 16th century, then were unaffected by population growth during the Industrial Revolution\u2014notably Wells (population about 10,000) and St Davids (population about 2,000). After the 16th century, no new dioceses (and no new cities) were created until the 19th century in England (a further city was created in Ireland during the rule of King James I in the 17th century).\n\n1836\u20131888[edit]\nA long-awaited resumption of creating dioceses began in 1836 with Ripon. Ripon Town Council assumed that this had elevated the town to the rank of a city, and started referring to itself as the City and Borough of Ripon. The next diocese formed was Manchester and its Borough Council began informally to use the title city. When Queen Victoria visited Manchester in 1851, widespread doubts surrounding its status were raised. The pretension was ended when the borough petitioned for city status, which was granted by letters patent in 1853. This eventually forced Ripon to regularise its position; its city status was recognised by Act of Parliament in 1865. From this year Ripon bore city status whilst the rapidly expanding conurbation of Leeds \u2013 in the Ripon diocese \u2013 did not. The Manchester case established a precedent that any municipal borough in which an Anglican see was established was entitled to petition for city status. Accordingly, Truro, St Albans, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Wakefield were all officially designated as cities between 1877 and 1888.\nThis was not without opposition from the Home Office, which dismissed St Albans as \"a fourth or fifth rate market town\" and objected to Wakefield's elevation on grounds of population. In one new diocese, Southwell, a city was not created, because it was a village without a borough corporation and therefore could not petition the Queen. The diocese covered the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and the boroughs of Derby and Nottingham were disappointed that they would not be able to claim the title of city.[11]\n\n1889\u20131907[edit]\n Birmingham was the first English town without an Anglican cathedral to be granted city status. Birmingham City Council meets at the Council House.\nThe link with Anglican dioceses was broken within England in 1889 when Birmingham successfully petitioned for city status (it was pre-empted in Ireland by Belfast in 1888) on the grounds of its large population and history of good local government. At the time of the grant, Birmingham lacked an Anglican cathedral, although the parish church later became a cathedral in 1905. This new precedent was followed by other large municipalities: Leeds and Sheffield became cities in 1893, and Bradford, Kingston upon Hull and Nottingham were honoured on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The last three had been the largest county boroughs outside the London area without city status.[11]\nBetween 1897 and 1914, applications were received from a number of other boroughs, but only Cardiff was successful in being designated a city in 1905 and granted a Lord Mayoralty as \"the Metropolis of Wales\".\n\nThe status of Westminster[edit]\nThe London Government Act 1899 abolished the existing local authorities within the County of London and replaced them with 28 metropolitan boroughs. Among the bodies to be dissolved was the Court of Burgesses of the City of Westminster. William Burdett-Coutts, one of Westminster's members of parliament, brought forward an amendment to rename the proposed borough of Greater Westminster to City of Westminster. This was intended to give \"recognition to the title which the area ... had possessed for over three and a half centuries\". He felt that if the status was not retained for the new borough it \"must necessarily disappear altogether\". The amendment was rejected by the government, however, with the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour, believing it would be \"an anomaly which, I think, would be not unnaturally resented by other districts which are as large in point of population as Westminster, although doubtless not so rich in historical associations\".[12][13] The government eventually relented, with Balfour stating that \"as soon as the necessary arrangements under the London Government Act have been completed, there will be conferred on the borough of Westminster, as constituted under the Act, the title of city, originally conferred in the time of Henry VIII\".[14][15] Letters patent were duly issued granting the title of \"city\" to the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.[16]\n\n1907\u20131953[edit]\nIn 1907, the Home Office and King Edward VII agreed on a policy that future applicants would have to meet certain criteria. This policy, which was not at the time made public, had the effect of stemming the number of city creations.\nThe 1907 policy contained three criteria:\n\nA minimum population of 300,000.\nA \"local metropolitan character\"\u2014this implied that the town had a distinct identity of its own and was the centre of a wider area.\nA good record of local government.[11]\nHowever, well into the 20th century it was often assumed that the presence of a cathedral was sufficient to elevate a town to city status, and that for cathedral cities the city charters were recognising its city status rather than granting it. On this basis, the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica said that Southwell and St Asaph were cities.\nThe policy laid down by Edward VII was continued by his successor, George V, who ascended the throne in 1910. In 1911, an application for city status by Portsmouth was refused. Explaining the Home Secretary's reason for not recommending the King to approve the petition, the Lord Advocate stated:\n\n...during the reign of his late Majesty it was found necessary, in order to maintain the value of the distinction, to lay down a rule as to the minimum population which should ordinarily, in connexion with other considerations, be regarded as qualifying a borough for that higher status.[17][18]\nFollowing the First World War, the King made an official visit to Leicester in 1919 to commemorate its contributions to the military victory. The borough council had made several applications for city status since 1889, and took the opportunity of the visit to renew its request. Leicester had a population of approximately 230,000 at the previous census, but its petition was granted as an exception to the policy, as it was officially a restoration of a dignity lost in the past.[19] When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent applied for city status in 1925, it was initially refused as it had only 294,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, however, as it was felt to have outstanding importance as the centre of the pottery industry. The effective relaxation of the population rule led to applications from Portsmouth and Salford. The civil servants in the Home Office were minded to refuse both applications. In particular, Salford was felt to be \"merely a scratch collection of 240,000 people cut off from Manchester by the river\". Salford's case, however, was considered favourably by the Home Secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, who had once been a Member of Parliament (MP) for a neighbouring constituency of Manchester North West. Following protests from Portsmouth, which felt it had better credentials as a larger town and as the \"first Naval Port of the kingdom\", both applications were approved in 1926.[11]\nIn 1927, a Royal Commission on Local Government was examining local council areas and functions in England and Wales. The question arose as to which towns were entitled to be called cities, and the chairman, the Earl of Onslow, wrote to the Home Office to seek clarification. The Home Office replied with a memorandum that read:\n\nThe title of a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction. It has no connexion with the status of the borough in respect of local government and confers no powers or privileges. At the present time and for several centuries past the title has been obtained only by an express grant from the Sovereign effected by letters patent; but a certain number of cities possess the title by very ancient prescriptive right. There is no necessary connexion between the title of a city and the seat of a bishopric, and the creation of a new see neither constitutes the town concerned a city nor gives it any claim to the grant of letters patent creating it a city.[20]\nIn 1928, Plymouth submitted an application for city status. As the borough had more inhabitants than Portsmouth and had absorbed Devonport and East Stonehouse, the King agreed to the request. However, he indicated that he had \"come to an end of city making\", and Southampton's application in the following year was turned down.[11] The next city to be created was Lancaster in 1937 as part of the celebrations of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. With a population of a little over 50,000, Lancaster was stated to be an exception due to the town's \"long association with the crown\" and because it was \"the county town of the King's Duchy of Lancaster\". Following the Second World War, members of Cambridge Borough Council made contact with Lancaster officials for assistance in their application. Cambridge became a city in 1951, again for \"exceptional\" reasons, as the only ancient seat of learning in the kingdom not a city or royal burgh and to coincide with the 750th anniversary of the borough's first charter of incorporation.[21] Croydon also applied in 1951, but failed as it was felt not to have a sufficient identity apart from Greater London, and reports on the conduct of local government in the town were unfavourable.[11]\n\n1953\u20131974[edit]\nIt was anticipated that the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 would lead to the creation of a city, and Wolverhampton, Preston and Southampton made approaches; the only civic honour given was that of a lord mayoralty to Coventry. Derby and Southwark made unsuccessful applications in 1955. The planned reorganisations by the Local Government Commissions for England and Wales from 1958 effectively blocked new city grants. Southampton lodged a petition in 1958. Initially refused in 1959, pending the decision of the commission, it was eventually allowed in 1964.[22] In the meantime, the administration of London was reformed under the London Government Act 1963. While the City of London was permitted to continue in existence largely unchanged, Westminster was merged with two neighbouring authorities to form a new London borough from 1 April 1965.[23] In December 1963 it was announced that a charter was to be granted incorporating the new authority as \"Westminster\", and that the Queen had accepted the advice of the Home Secretary to raise the London borough to the title and dignity of city.[24] This example, of a successor local authority to a merged local government entity taking on that former entity's city status, was to be replicated in many instances as a result of the 1972/74 local government reforms across England and Wales (see below).\nWith the establishment of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England in 1966, city grants were again in abeyance in England. Attempts by Derby, Teesside and Wolverhampton to become cities were not proceeded with. In Wales, Swansea campaigned for city status throughout the 1960s. The campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1969, in conjunction with the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales.[25]\n\n1974 reorganisation and new cities[edit]\nThe Local Government Act 1972 abolished all existing local authorities outside London (other than parish councils) in England and Wales. This meant that the various local authorities that held city status ceased to exist on 1 April 1974.[26] To preserve city status new letters patent were issued to the most relevant metropolitan borough, non-metropolitan district or successor parish councils created by the Act.[27] Some of these came to cover local government districts many times wider than the previous city, even taking in many square miles of rural land outside the urban areas, for example the cities of Bradford, Leeds and Winchester. Three non-local authority preservations arose: here charter trustees were established for the cities of Lichfield and Salisbury (or New Sarum) being neither districts nor civil parishes, and special letters patent for a time preserved the city of Rochester.[28]\nIn 1977, as part of the celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the Home Office identified nine candidates for city status: Blackburn, Brighton, Croydon, Derby, Dudley, Newport, Sandwell, Sunderland and Wolverhampton.[11] Ultimately, Derby received the award as the largest non-metropolitan district not already designated a city.[29] In April 1980 a parish council was created for Lichfield, and the charter trustees established six years earlier were dissolved. City status was temporarily lost until new letters patent were issued in November of the same year.[30] In 1992, on the fortieth anniversary of the monarch's accession, it was announced that another town would be elevated to a city. An innovation on this occasion was that a competition was to be held, and communities would be required to submit applications. Sunderland was the successful applicant.[31] This was followed in 1994 by the restoration of the dignity to St David's, historic see of a bishop.[32] Since 2000, city status has been awarded to towns or local government districts by competition on special occasions. A large number of towns have applied for the honour in recent decades including Blackpool, Colchester, Croydon, Gateshead, Ipswich, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Reading, Swindon and Warrington. Four successful applicants in England have become cities, as well as two in Wales; in 2000 for the Millennium celebrations, the new cities were Brighton and Hove and Wolverhampton; in 2002 for the Queen's Golden Jubilee it was Preston and Newport, and in 2012 for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee it was Chelmsford and St Asaph.[33][34][35][36]\n\n2021 bids for city status[edit]\nMain article: Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours\nFrom June 2021, submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2022. Places submitting bids (some for a second or subsequent time) included Bangor (Northern Ireland), Bournemouth, Doncaster, Dunfermline, Dudley,[37] Marazion,[38] Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes,[39] Reading,[40] St Andrews and Wrexham.[41] Bids were also accepted from overseas territories and crown dependencies and George Town (in the Cayman Islands), Gibraltar, Stanley (in the Falkland Islands), Douglas and Peel (both in the Isle of Man) were among those applying. The competition closed on 8 December 2021 with 39 locations on the shortlist, and the winners were to be announced in June 2022.[42][43]\nOn 18 October 2021, the  Prime Minister announced in Parliament that the Queen, in advance of the closing date, would accord city status to one of the applicants, Southend-on-Sea.[44] This was in memory of Sir David Amess, the town's MP who was murdered three days earlier and had long pressed for the status.[45] City status was officially granted by letters patent dated 26 January 2022. They were presented to Southend Borough Council by Charles, Prince of Wales, on 1 March 2022.[46]\nAn announcement on 20 May 2022 declared that eight new cities were to be created from the shortlist, with at least one in every UK country as well as in overseas territories. In England, Milton Keynes, Colchester and Doncaster were to be the recipients of the honour. Dunfermline, a previous royal capital of Scotland, was granted the privilege. Bangor in Northern Ireland was also a recipient, and the title in Wales was granted to Wrexham. Once these locations receive their letters patents later in 2022, this will increase the number of official mainland cities to 76, with 55 in England, eight in Scotland, seven in Wales, six in Northern Ireland. Outside the UK, Stanley, in the Falklands Islands, as well as Douglas, in the Isle of Man, were given the status, which will take the total to four cities after confirmations, with one in the Crown Dependencies and three in British Overseas Territories.[47]\n\nGreater London[edit]\nOther than the cities of London and Westminster, no local authorities in the Greater London area have been granted city status. The Home Office had a policy of resisting any attempt by metropolitan boroughs to become cities even when their populations, and other proposed claims as qualifying criteria, might otherwise have made them eligible. It was felt that such a grant would undermine the status of the two existing cities in the capital. The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark made a number of applications, but in 1955 the borough's town clerk was told not to pursue the matter any further.[11] Outside the boundaries of the county, the County Borough of Croydon made three applications, all of which were dismissed as it was not seen as being sufficiently separate from London. When the successor London Borough of Croydon applied in 1965 the Assistant Under Secretary of State summarised the case against Croydon: \"...whatever its past history, it is now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs\".[11]\nThe same objections were made when the London Boroughs of Croydon and Southwark unsuccessfully entered the competition for city status to mark the millennium: Croydon was said to have \"no particular identity of its own\" while Southwark was \"part of London with little individual identity\".[11] When the competition was held to mark the Golden Jubilee of 2002, Croydon made a sixth application, again unsuccessful. It was joined by the London Borough of Greenwich, which emphasised its royal and maritime connections, while claiming to be \"to London what Versailles is to Paris\".[11] In this vein Greenwich joined Kingston-upon-Thames and Kensington and Chelsea in London in having the title of Royal Borough in 2012.[48]\n\nRochester[edit]\nRochester was recognised as a city from 1211 to 1998. On 1 April 1974, the city council was abolished, becoming part of the Borough of Medway, a local government district in the county of Kent. However, under letters patent the former city council area was to continue to be styled the \"City of Rochester\" to \"perpetuate the ancient name\" and to recall \"the long history and proud heritage of the said city\".[49] The city was unique, as it had no council or charter trustees and no mayor or civic head. In 1979, the Borough of Medway was renamed as Rochester-upon-Medway, and in 1982 further letters patent transferred the city status to the entire borough.[50] On 1 April 1998, the existing local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham were abolished and became the new unitary authority of Medway. Since it was the local government district that officially held city status under the 1982 letters patent, when it was abolished, it also ceased to be a city. Whilst the two other local government districts with city status (Bath and Hereford) that were abolished around this time decided to appoint charter trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty, Rochester-upon-Medway City Council did not do so. Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, they discovered that Rochester was not on the Lord Chancellor's Office's list of cities.[51][52] In 2010, it started to refer to the \"City of Medway\" in promotional material, but it was rebuked and instructed not to do so in future by the Advertising Standards Authority.[53]\n\nScotland[edit]\nScotland had no cities by royal charter or letters patent before 1889.[54] The nearest equivalent in pre-Union Scotland was the royal burgh. The term city was not always consistently applied, and there were doubts over the number of officially designated cities. The royal burghs of Edinburgh and Perth anciently used the title civitas, but the term city does not seem to have been used before the 15th century. Unlike the situation in England, in Scotland there was no link between the presence of a cathedral and the title of city. Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh were accepted as cities by ancient usage by the 18th century, while Perth and Elgin also used the title.[11] In 1856, the burgh of Dunfermline resolved to use the title of city in all official documents in the future, based on long usage and its former status as a royal capital. The status was never officially recognised.[11]\nIn 1889, Dundee was granted city status by letters patent. The grant by formal document led to doubts about the use of the title city by other burghs. In 1891, the city status of Aberdeen was confirmed when the burgh was enlarged by local Act of Parliament. The Royal Burgh of Inverness applied for promotion to a city as part of the Jubilee honours in 1897. The request was not granted, partly because it would draw attention to the lack of any charter granting the title to existing cities.[11] Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow were constituted \"counties of cities\" by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. The Act made no statement on the title city for any other burgh. In 1969, the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, stated that there were six cities in Scotland (without naming them) and Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Elgin, Glasgow and Perth were the only burghs listed as cities in 1972.[11][55]\nThe Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 completely reorganised Scotland's local administration in 1975. All burghs were abolished, and a system of districts created. The four districts of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow had City included in their titles by the Act. The 1975 districts were replaced with the present council areas in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, and the same four cities were designated. Since the 1996 reorganisation, three more Scottish cities have been designated: Inverness as part of the millennium celebrations, Stirling in 2002 to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee and Perth in 2012 to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.[36] In the case of these three cities, there are no city councils and no formal boundaries. In January 2008, a petition to matriculate armorial bearings for the City of Inverness was refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms on the grounds that there is no corporate body or legal persona to whom arms can be granted.[56]\n\nIreland and Northern Ireland[edit]\nSee also: City status in Ireland\nCity status in Ireland tended historically to be granted by royal charter. There are many towns in Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that have never been called cities. In spite of this, Armagh was considered a city, by virtue of its being the seat of the Primate of All Ireland, until the abolition of Armagh's city corporation by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. The only historic city with a charter in present-day Northern Ireland is Derry. Derry was given its first charter by James I in 1604, but the garrison was attacked and destroyed by Cahir O'Doherty in 1608.[57] The present city is the result of a second charter granted in 1613 to members of the London guilds, as part of the Plantation of Ulster, providing for the building of a walled city, which was renamed Londonderry.[58]\nIn 1887, the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria was celebrated, and the Borough of Belfast submitted a memorial to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland seeking city status. Belfast based its claim on its similarity to two English boroughs that had received the honour\u2014the seaport of Liverpool and the textile centre of Manchester\u2014and the fact that it had (at the time) a larger population than the City of Dublin. Following some legal debate, city status was conferred in 1888. The grant of the honour on the grounds of being a large industrial town, rather than a diocesan centre, was unprecedented. Belfast's example was soon followed by Birmingham in England and Dundee in Scotland.[11]\nIn 1994, Armagh's city status was restored.[32] In 2002, Lisburn and Newry were two of the five towns in the UK that were granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II to mark her Golden Jubilee. In the case of Lisburn, the status extends to the entire local government district.[59] Newry, like Inverness and Stirling in Scotland, has no formal boundaries or city council. The letters patent were presented to representatives of Newry and Mourne District Council on behalf of the city.[60]\n\nCrown colonies and British Overseas Territories[edit]\nDuring the British Empire, the Colonial Office had the power to declare cities in Crown colonies by letters patent when appointing bishops. When the Bishop of Guyana was created in 1842, Georgetown (then part of British Guiana) was officially declared the \"City of Georgetown\". The same process was followed for Gibraltar, Jamestown, St Helena, Bridgetown, Barbados, St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda, Victoria, Hong Kong and Nassau, Bahamas.[11]  Most of these have since gained independence from the United Kingdom, but Gibraltar and St Helena remain British Overseas Territories. This practice ended in 1865.[11]\nHamilton, Bermuda was named as a city in 1897 as part of the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.[61] In 2022, as part of the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was also declared a city. Although previously named a city, Gibraltar also applied for city status, as did George Town, Cayman Islands.[62][63]\n\nCurrent practice of granting city status[edit]\nAccording to a Memorandum from the Home Office issued in 1927,\n\nIf a town wishes to obtain the title of a city the proper method of procedure is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and in exceptional circumstances that the title is given.[20]\nA town can now apply for city status by submitting an application to the Lord Chancellor, who makes recommendations to the sovereign. Competitions for new grants of city status have been held to mark special events, such as coronations, royal jubilees or the Millennium.\n\nLord mayors[edit]\nMain article: List of lord mayoralties and lord provostships in the United Kingdom\nSome cities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have the further distinction of having a lord mayor rather than a simple mayor \u2013 in Scotland, the equivalent is the lord provost. Lord mayors have the right to be styled \"The Right Worshipful The Lord Mayor\". The lord mayors and provosts of Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, the City of London and York have the further right to be styled \"The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor\" (or Provost), although they are not members of the Privy Council as this style usually indicates. The style is associated with the office, not the person holding it, so \"The Right Worshipful Joseph Bloggsworthy\" would be incorrect.\nThere are currently 70 recognised cities (including 31 lord mayoralties or lord provostships) in the UK: 52 cities (23 lord mayoralties) in England, six cities (two lord mayoralties) in Wales, seven cities (four lord provostships) in Scotland and five cities (two lord mayoralties) in Northern Ireland.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the ceremonial head of the city government of Dublin is the Lord Mayor of Dublin. This title was granted by Charles II in 1665 when Dublin was part of the Kingdom of Ireland. Whilst the 1665 letters patent provided for the Lord Mayor to hold the formal title of Right Honourable, this was repealed in 2001. There is also a Lord Mayor of Cork, a title granted in 1900 when Cork was part of the (then) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nIn modern practice, competitions are held for cities that wish to gain the distinction of a lord mayor. The 2002 competition was entered by Bath, Cambridge, Carlisle, Chichester, Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Lancaster, Lincoln, St Albans, St Davids, Salford, Southampton, Sunderland, Truro, Wolverhampton and Worcester; the successful candidate was Exeter.[64] In 2012 a further competition was held, as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, with Armagh receiving the distinction.[65] Other than Armagh, eleven cities had entered the contest in 2012, namely: Cambridge, Derby, Gloucester, Lancaster, Newport, Peterborough, Salford, Southampton, St Albans, Sunderland, and Wakefield.[66]\n\nLocal government districts[edit]\nSince local government reorganisation in 1974 city status has been awarded to a number of local government districts which are not themselves towns. Each includes a number of towns and villages outside the urban area from which the district takes its name. In some of these cases city status was awarded to districts where the largest settlement had city status before 1974. In other cases a borough was formed to govern an area covering several towns and then city status was granted to the borough. The largest \"city\" district in terms of area is the City of Carlisle, which covers some 400 square miles (1,000\u00a0km2) of mostly rural landscape in the north of England, and is larger than smaller counties such as Merseyside or Rutland. Such cities include:\n\nCity of Bradford, including the towns of Bingley, Ilkley, Keighley and Shipley as well as Bradford\nCity of Canterbury, including the towns of Herne Bay and Whitstable as well as Canterbury\nCity of Lancaster, including the towns of Carnforth, Heysham and Morecambe as well as Lancaster and surrounding rural areas.\nCity of Leeds, including the towns of Otley, Pudsey and Wetherby as well as Leeds\nCity of Peterborough, including rural areas as well as Peterborough\nCity of Preston, including rural areas as well as Preston\nCity of St Albans, including the town of Harpenden as well as St Albans\nCity of Salford, including the towns of Eccles, Pendlebury and Swinton as well as Salford\nCity of Sunderland, including the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring and Washington as well as Sunderland\nCity of Wakefield, including the towns of Castleford, Ossett and Pontefract as well as Wakefield\nCity of Winchester, including the towns of Bishop's Waltham and New Alresford as well as Winchester\nThere are some cities where the local government district is in fact smaller than the historical or natural boundaries of the city. Examples include: Manchester, where the traditional area associated includes areas of the neighbouring authorities of Trafford, Tameside, Oldham, Bury and the City of Salford; Kingston upon Hull, where surrounding areas and villages that are effectively suburbs, such as Cottingham, come under East Riding of Yorkshire Council; Glasgow, where suburban areas of the city are located in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire; Wolverhampton and London.\n\nCity councils[edit]\nSee also: List of cities in the United Kingdom\nThe holding of city status gives a settlement no special rights other than that of calling itself a \"city\". Nonetheless, this appellation carries its own prestige and, consequently, competitions for the status are hard-fought.\nHistorically, city status could only be granted to incorporated towns. The grant was specifically awarded to the relevant local government area such as a civil parish or borough. However, recent grants have used a looser wording, where the status is awarded to the \"town\". In most cases the \"town\" is held to be coterminous with the relevant local government area, such that the city status holder is the corporate body of the council. Examples include the Letters Patent awarded to the \"Towns of Brighton and Hove\", the \"Town of Wolverhampton\" and the \"Town of Newport in the County Borough of Newport\". In each case the existing borough council became the city council.\nMost cities have city councils, which have varying powers depending on the country and type of settlement.\n\nEngland[edit]\nTwelve of the 52 cities in England are in metropolitan counties and their city councils are single-tier metropolitan district councils. Outside the metropolitan counties thirteen cities are unitary authorities, and fourteen have ordinary district councils, which are subordinate to their local county council. In London the Westminster City Council functions as a London borough council, and the City of London Corporation is the council for the City of London. Eight smaller episcopal cities such as Ripon and Wells are neither local government districts nor within a 'local government district with city status', and have city councils which are parish councils, with limited powers. Two cities (Bath and Chester) have no city council, while Durham has a 'city' parish council \u2013 these however, maintain the status through charter trustees on behalf of their prior district areas which held city status before being abolished in 1996 and 2009.[67][68][69]\n\nScotland[edit]\nAberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow are themselves council areas and have their own city councils. The cities of Perth, Stirling and Inverness are part of council areas which do not have city status, and have no city councils. Stirling Council's application for city status was specifically for the urban area of the (now former) Royal Burgh of Stirling and included proposed city boundaries which are much smaller than Stirling council area.\n\nWales[edit]\nCardiff, Newport and Swansea are principal areas and have city councils. The city councils of Bangor, St Asaph and St Davids are community councils with limited powers.\n\nNorthern Ireland[edit]\nBelfast City Council is a local government district council. Since the local government reforms of 2015 the four other cities of Armagh, Derry, Lisburn and Newry form parts of wider districts and do not have their own councils.\n\nCity status conferment[edit]\nCity status is conferred by letters patent and not by a royal charter (except historically in Ireland). There are twenty towns in England and Wales that were recognised as cities by \"ancient prescriptive right\"; none of these communities had been formally declared a city, but they had all used the title since \"time immemorial\", that is, before 3 September 1189, and had been granted some form of privilege such as freedoms by way of a charter or being given borough or corporation status.[11] A list of these ancient cities was produced by the Home Office in 1927[70] and were:\n\n\nBangor (Wales)\nBath\nCanterbury\nCarlisle\nChichester\nCoventry\nDurham\nEly\nExeter\nHereford\nLichfield\nLincoln\nCity of London\nNorwich\nRochester (status lost in 1998)\nSalisbury\nWells\nWinchester\nWorcester\nYork\n\nThese twenty cities were concurrent with 22 ancient diocese (pre-English Reformation) locations.[71] Bath and Wells being one diocese, the remaining three are in Wales:\n\nLlandaff \u2014 had not been incorporated as a borough or granted privileges so was not deemed a city. It was merged into the existing city of Cardiff in 1922;[72]\nSt Asaph \u2014 was never considered to be a city due to a lack of honours or charters, however it was later awarded the status in 2012;[71][73]\nSt Davids \u2014 had been a borough, yet lost the status in 1886 (so did not appear in the above list). The title of city was restored in 1994.[74]\nThe holding of city status brings no special benefits other than the right to be called a city. All cities where a local government unit that holds that status is abolished have to be re-issued with letters patent reconfirming city status following local government reorganisation where that holder has been abolished. This process was followed by a number of cities since 1974, and York and Hereford's status was confirmed twice, in 1974 and again in the 1990s. Failure to do so leads to the loss of city status as happened at Rochester in 1998 (see above), and also previously in St David's and Armagh, although both of these latter have regained city status since losing it. These three had been cities since time immemorial before the loss of city status.\nThe formal definition of a city has been disputed,[citation needed] in particular by inhabitants of towns that have been regarded as cities in the past such as Colchester, which was considered[by whom?] a city from Roman times until 1542,[citation needed] and Dunfermline,[citation needed] although neither are legally cities today. Additionally, although the Crown clearly has the right to bestow \"official\" city status, some[who?] have doubted the right of the Crown to define the word city in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] In informal usage, city can be used for large towns or conurbations that are not formally cities. The best-known example of this is London, which contains two cities (the City of London and the City of Westminster) but is not itself a city, as well as Milton Keynes which was often referred to as a city and was even planned as a \"new city\" but was not officially approved for grant of the status until 2022.\n\nOfficially designated cities[edit]\nThere are currently 70 officially designated cities in the UK, of which 11 have been created since 2000 in competitions to celebrate the new millennium and Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002, Diamond Jubilee in 2012, and Platinum Jubilee in 2022.[75] The designation is highly sought after, with over 40 communities submitting bids at recent competitions.\n\nList of officially designated cities[edit]\nCity status has been applied to a variety of entities including towns, local government districts and civil parishes.\nSee List of cities in the United Kingdom for a list of entities holding the status for each city, and a map of all of them.\nEach icon below leads to a map of the area with city status.\nEngland[edit]\n\n\u00a0 Bath\n\u00a0 Birmingham\n\u00a0 Bradford\n\u00a0 Brighton and Hove\n\u00a0 Bristol\n\u00a0 Cambridge\n\u00a0 Canterbury\n\u00a0 Carlisle\n\u00a0 Chelmsford\n\u00a0 Chester\n\u00a0 Chichester\n\u00a0 Coventry\n\u00a0 Derby\n\u00a0 Durham\n\u00a0 Ely\n\u00a0 Exeter\n\u00a0 Gloucester\n\u00a0 Hereford\n\u00a0 Kingston upon Hull\n\u00a0 Lancaster\n\u00a0 Leeds\n\u00a0 Leicester\n\u00a0 Lichfield\n\u00a0 Lincoln\n\u00a0 Liverpool\n\u00a0 City of London\n\u00a0 Manchester\n\u00a0 Newcastle upon Tyne\n\u00a0 Norwich\n\u00a0 Nottingham\n\u00a0 Oxford\n\u00a0 Peterborough\n\u00a0 Plymouth\n\u00a0 Portsmouth\n\u00a0 Preston\n\u00a0 Ripon\n\u00a0 Salford\n\u00a0 Salisbury\n\u00a0 Sheffield\n\u00a0 Southend-on-Sea\n\u00a0 Southampton\n\u00a0 St Albans\n\u00a0 Stoke-on-Trent\n\u00a0 Sunderland\n\u00a0 Truro\n\u00a0 Wakefield\n\u00a0 Wells\n\u00a0 City of Westminster\n\u00a0 Winchester\n\u00a0 Wolverhampton\n\u00a0 Worcester\n\u00a0 York\n\n\nScotland[edit]\n\n\u00a0 Aberdeen\n\u00a0 Dundee\n\u00a0 Edinburgh\n\u00a0 Glasgow\n\u00a0 Inverness\n\u00a0 Perth\n\u00a0 Stirling\n\n\nWales[edit]\n\n\u00a0 Bangor\n\u00a0 Cardiff\n\u00a0 Newport\n\u00a0 St Asaph\n\u00a0 St Davids\n\u00a0 Swansea\n\n\nNorthern Ireland[edit]\n\n\u00a0 Armagh\n\u00a0 Belfast\n\u00a0 Lisburn\n\u00a0 Derry\n\u00a0 Newry\n\n\nFuture UK cities[edit]\n\u00a0 Colchester, England\n\u00a0 Doncaster, England\n\u00a0 Milton Keynes, England\n\u00a0 Dunfermline, Scotland\n\u00a0 Wrexham, Wales\n\u00a0 Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland\n\nSmallest and largest cities[edit]\nWhile cities are regularly ranked by the number of residents, this is not an ideal measure. Population can vary based on the number and type of residences present, and has to be limited to an area. As mentioned earlier in the article, the official area of a city in the UK is typically the coverage up to a local government/council boundary,[76] there being a variety of council bodies. However, there are exceptions depending on the UK constituent country[77] and whether the council has since been abolished.\nSuch a boundary can typically contain a built up (urban) area, and a surrounding, less populated rural landscape. Inversely, the area of a city can be entirely built up, with that urban environment spilling over a boundary into another area which does not have city status. That wider urban area can still be considered in everyday parlance locally as a whole 'city' although it is not a formal designation.\nWith the 'square mile' City of London being in the middle of a huge urban area, it can be suggested that 'small' should be applied to only cities with minimal urban areas that have nearby surrounding areas of countryside and so is visibly representative of the term, Wells being more suitable in this regard as the smallest standalone city council area. Therefore, sizing can be interpreted in a number of ways, and below are top 5 lists of the smallest and largest cities ranked by population, city council area, and urban area.\nAll statistics are 2011 census figures.[78]\nPopulation is of the total residents in the city council area. Armagh (no local council) and the Largest Urban Area table both use urban population figures.\n\nSmallest[edit]\nMain article: List of smallest cities in the United Kingdom\n\n\nSmallest by population\n\n\n1\n\nSt Davids\n\n1,841\n\nWales\n\n\n2\n\nSt Asaph\n\n3,355\n\nWales\n\n\n3\n\nCity of London\n\n7,375\n\nEngland\n\n\n4\n\nWells\n\n10,536\n\nEngland\n\n\n5\n\nArmagh\n\n14,749\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nSmallest by city council area\n\n\n1\n\nCity of London\n\n1.12\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (2.90\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n2\n\nWells\n\n2.11\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (5.46\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n3\n\nSt Asaph\n\n2.49\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (6.45\u00a0km2)\n\nWales\n\n\n4\n\nBangor\n\n2.79\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (7.23\u00a0km2)\n\nWales\n\n\n5\n\nRipon\n\n3.83\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (9.92\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n\nSmallest by overall urban area\n\n\n1\n\nSt Davids\n\n0.23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (0.60\u00a0km2)\n\nWales\n\n\n2\n\nSt Asaph\n\n0.50\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1.29\u00a0km2)\n\nWales\n\n\n3\n\nWells\u2020\n\n1.35\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (3.50\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n4\n\nBangor\u2020\n\n1.65\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (4.27\u00a0km2)\n\nWales\n\n\n5\n\nEly\n\n1.84\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (4.77\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\u2020 Urban areas which extend beyond the city council boundary. It is not always possible to obtain the urban area size of a city alone when the total built-up area (BUA) extends beyond the council boundary. The ONS does sometimes isolate an approximate city urban portion as a built-up area subdivision (BUASD) but those can also spill over borders. To maintain consistency, BUA figures are given, which tend to be not much larger than BUASDs for the smallest of cities, and both Wells and Bangor's rankings in the table would remain the same if BUASDs were substituted instead.\nThe least populous cities on all of British territory are Jamestown in St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (pop. 629) and Hamilton in Bermuda (pop. 854).\n\nLargest[edit]\nMain articles: List of cities, with their councils including populations; List of English districts by area; List of Welsh principal areas by area; List of Scottish council areas by area; List of districts in Northern Ireland by area; and List of urban areas in the United Kingdom\n\n\nLargest by population\n\n\n1\n\nBirmingham\n\n1,073,045\n\nEngland\n\n\n2\n\nLeeds\n\n751,485\n\nEngland\n\n\n3\n\nGlasgow\n\n603,080\n\nScotland\n\n\n4\n\nSheffield\n\n552,698\n\nEngland\n\n\n5\n\nBradford\n\n522,452\n\nEngland\n\n\n\nLargest by city council area\u2021\n\n\n1\n\nCity of Carlisle\n\n401.28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,039.31\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n2\n\nCity of Winchester\n\n255.20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (660.96\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n3\n\nCity of Lancaster\n\n222.34\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (575.86\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n4\n\nCity of Leeds\n\n213.02\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (551.72\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n\n5\n\nSwansea\n\n146.62\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (379.74\u00a0km2)\n\nWales\n\n\n\nLargest by overall urban area\n\nPopulation\n\n\n1\n\nCity of London/City of Westminster (Greater London BUA)\n\n670.99\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,737.86\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n9,787,426\n\n\n2\n\nManchester/Salford (Greater Manchester BUA)\n\n243.34\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (630.25\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n2,553,379\n\n\n3\n\nBirmingham/Wolverhampton (West Midlands BUA)\n\n231.23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (598.88\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n2,440,986\n\n\n4\n\nLeeds/Bradford/Wakefield (West Yorkshire BUA)\n\n188.34\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (487.80\u00a0km2)\n\nEngland\n\n1,777,934\n\n\n5\n\nGlasgow (Greater Glasgow)\n\n142.28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (368.50\u00a0km2)\n\nScotland\n\n1,209,143\n\n\u2021 Excludes cities that do not have their own councils or have other settlements in their council name.\n\nTowns not cities[edit]\nPopulous towns[edit]\nSee also: List of urban areas in the United Kingdom and Unparished area\nAs noted above, in ordinary discourse, city can refer to any large settlement, with no fixed limit.

The name shown is the largest town in the area:\n\n\n\nApplicable Local authority(civil parish)\n\nTown\n\nBuilt-up area\n\n\nName & county\nPopulation 2011 Pop.\n\nName\nPopulation 2011 Pop.\nIncludes city [79]\n\n\nReading Borough Council\nReading, Berkshire\n218,705[80]\n\nReading built-up area\n318,014\n\n\n\nSlough Borough Council\nSlough, Berkshire\n133,860 [81]\n\nSlough\n163,777\n\n\n\nLuton Borough Council\n\nLuton, Bedfordshire\n211,228[82]\n\nLuton\n258,018\n\n\n\nBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council\n\nBournemouth, Dorset\n187,503[83]\n\nBournemouth/Poole\n466,266\n\n\n\nWarrington Borough Council\n\nWarrington, Cheshire\n165,456[84]\n\nWarrington\n165,456\n\n\n\nBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council\n\nPoole, Dorset\n154,718[85]\n\nBournemouth/Poole\n466,266\n\n\n\nBlackpool Council\n\nBlackpool, Lancashire\n147,663[86]\n\nBlackpool\n239,409\n\n\n\nEastbourne Borough Council\n\nEastbourne, East Sussex\n109,185[87]\n\nEastbourne\n118,219\n\n\n\nBasildon Borough Council\n\nBasildon, Essex\n107,123[88]\n\nBasildon\n144,859\n\n\n\nCheltenham Borough Council\n\nCheltenham, Gloucestershire\n116,447[89]\n\nCheltenham\n116,447\n\n\n\nBasingstoke and Deane Borough Council\n\nBasingstoke, Hampshire\n107,355 [90]\n\nBasingstoke\n107,642\n\n\n\nWatford Borough Council\n\nWatford, Hertfordshire\n131,982[91]\n\nGreater London\n9,787,426\nLondon, St Albans and Westminster\n\n\nMaidstone Borough Council\n\nMaidstone, Kent\n107,627[92]\n\nMaidstone\n107,627\n\n\n\nWirral Council\n\nBirkenhead, Merseyside\n142,968[93]\n\nBirkenhead\n325,264\n\n\n\nMiddlesbrough Council\n\nMiddlesbrough, North Yorkshire\n174,700[94]\n\nTeesside\n376,633\n\n\n\nWest Northamptonshire Council (Northampton Town Council)\n\nNorthampton, Northamptonshire\n215,173[95]\n\nNorthampton\n215,963\n\n\n\nTelford and Wrekin Council\n\nTelford, Shropshire\n142,723[96]\n\nTelford\n147,980\n\n\n\nIpswich Borough Council\n\nIpswich, Suffolk\n144,957[97]\n\nIpswich\n178,835\n\n\n\nWoking Borough Council\n\nWoking, Surrey\n105,367[98]\n\nGreater London\n9,787,426\nLondon, St Albans and Westminster\n\n\nWorthing Borough Council\n\nWorthing, West Sussex\n109,120[99]\n\nBrighton and Hove\n474,485\nBrighton and Hove\n\n\nKirklees Council\n\nHuddersfield, West Yorkshire\n162,949[100]\n\nWest Yorkshire\n1,777,934\nBradford, Leeds, Wakefield\n\n\nSwindon Borough Council\n\nSwindon, Wiltshire\n182,441[101]\n\nSwindon\n185,609\n\n\n\nMedway Council\n\nGillingham, Kent\n104,157[102]\n\nMedway Towns\n243,931\nRochester (former)\n\n\nBolton Council\n\nBolton, Greater Manchester\n194,189[103]\n\nGreater Manchester\n2,553,379\nManchester and Salford\n\n\nTrafford Council\n\nSale, Greater Manchester\n134,022 [104]\n\nGreater Manchester\n2,553,379\nManchester and Salford\n\n\nRochdale Borough Council\n\nRochdale, Greater Manchester\n107,926 [105]\n\nGreater Manchester\n2,553,379\nManchester and Salford\n\n\nStockport Metropolitan Borough Council\n\nStockport, Greater Manchester\n105,878 [106]\n\nGreater Manchester\n2,553,379\nManchester and Salford\n\n\nGateshead Council\n\nGateshead, Tyne and Wear\n120,046 [107]\n\nTyneside\n774,891\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne\n\n\nSolihull Council\n\nSolihull, West Midlands\n123,187 [108]\n\nWest Midlands\n2,440,986\nBirmingham and Wolverhampton\n\nSome of the largest London Boroughs:\n\nLondon Borough of Croydon \u2013 330,587\nLondon Borough of Southwark \u2013 244,866\nLondon Borough of Tower Hamlets \u2013 220,500\nLondon Borough of Greenwich \u2013 214,403 (became a Royal Borough on 3 February 2012)\nCathedral towns[edit]\nEngland and Wales[edit]\nSince being the seat of an Anglican diocese is no longer sufficient or necessary to gain city status, some cathedral towns exist:\n\n\n\nPlace\n\nCathedral\n\nDiocese established\n\nPopulation (Est)\n\n\nBlackburn\n\nBlackburn Cathedral\n\n1926\n\n105,085\n\n\nBrecon\n\nBrecon Cathedral\n\n1923\n\n7,901\n\n\nBury St Edmunds\n\nSt Edmundsbury Cathedral\n\n1914\n\n35,015\n\n\nGuildford\n\nGuildford Cathedral\n\n1927\n\n70,000\n\n\nRochester\n\nRochester Cathedral\n\nhistoric;previously a city (see above)\n\n27,000\n\n\nSouthwell\n\nSouthwell Minster\n\n1884\n\n6,900\n\nThe 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica refers to Southwell as a city,[109] and in 1949 Bury St Edmunds is referred to as a city.[110]\nIn total there are 15 English and Welsh cities that have never had Anglican cathedrals within their borders \u2013 Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Nottingham, Plymouth, Preston, Salford, Southampton, Southend-on-Sea, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, and Wolverhampton.[111]\nBath Abbey was once a diocesan cathedral, as was Westminster Abbey briefly during the reign of Henry VIII. These cities retained their city status despite their cathedrals losing that status.\n\nScotland[edit]\nThe national church of Scotland, the Church of Scotland, is presbyterian in governance (not recognising authority of bishops), and thus has high kirks rather than cathedrals. However, the pre-Reformation dioceses do have extant cathedrals, most notably at Glasgow and Aberdeen, which remain in use by the Church of Scotland and continue to bear the honorific title of cathedral. Others (such as that of St Andrews) are now in ruins.\nAs noted above, both Perth and Elgin were recognised as cities before 1975 (Perth's city status was restored in 2012[112]). Additionally, five other pre-Reformation sees\u2014Brechin, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Kirkwall and St Andrews\u2014are often referred to as cities, notably in names associated with the settlements (e.g. Brechin City F.C., City Road in St Andrews). Dornoch, Fortrose, Lismore, Saddell and Whithorn also possess pre-Reformation cathedrals but have never been described as cities.\nTowns with non-Church of Scotland, post-Reformation cathedrals which are not recognised as cities are Ayr (R.C.), Millport (Episcopal), Oban (R.C.), Motherwell (R.C.) and Paisley (R.C.). Of these, Ayr, Motherwell and Paisley have larger populations than Perth, Stirling and Inverness, and both Ayr and Paisley have formally made a bid for city status during the millennium competition.[113]\nOf settlements granted city status in the 21st century, Inverness (awarded 2001) possesses an Episcopal cathedral (1866), but none under the auspices of the Church of Scotland. Stirling (awarded 2002) has never had a cathedral of any kind. Perth (reinstated 2012) has an Episcopal cathedral dating from 1860, but no pre-Reformation establishment.\n\nNorthern Ireland[edit]\nIn Northern Ireland, as noted above, possession of a diocesan cathedral has never (except in the anomalous case of Armagh) been sufficient to attain this status. In addition, the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871.\nIn spite of this, the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica refers to Armagh (Armagh had lost city status in 1840) and Lisburn as cities. Armagh subsequently regained city status formally in 1994 and Lisburn achieved city status in 2002.\nThere are four towns in Northern Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that do not have city status\u2014Clogher, Downpatrick, Dromore and Enniskillen. \nNewry is the only city in Northern Ireland that does not have a Church of Ireland cathedral within its borders.\n\nClaimants[edit]\nA number of towns describe themselves as cities (at least in some contexts), despite not having the requisite Charter.\n\nBallymena in Northern Ireland has been known informally as \"The City of the Seven Towers\" since the nineteenth century.[114]\nThe community council for Brechin is called City of Brechin & District Community Council. The local football team is known as Brechin City F.C. (they were formed at a meeting on City Road in the town). Brechin also possesses a cathedral, and was the ancient seat of the see of Brechin.\nDunkeld, the see of a bishop until the seventeenth century is sometimes referred to as a city. A \"City Hall\" was built in 1877, since converted into a holiday accommodation.[115][116]\nThe community council for Elgin is called City and Royal Burgh of Elgin Community Council. The local football team is known as Elgin City F.C.\nGuildford possesses a cathedral and the local football team is named Guildford City F.C. In 2013 the local council did not submit an application, citing low chance of success, and high time and resource against low benefits ratio.[117]\nLetchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City are medium-sized New Towns in Hertfordshire established to reduce the overcrowding of London as part of the Garden city movement.\nAfter its unsuccessful attempts to gain city status, the town of Reading, Berkshire, started using the phrase \"City Centre\" on its buses[118] and car-park signs. Reading's urban area has in excess of 350,000 inhabitants, making it one of the largest urban areas in the UK and larger than many sizeable cities including Southampton, Kingston upon Hull and Derby. However, the population of the Borough of Reading was estimated as 142,800 in 2006 by the Office for National Statistics, as a number of the town's large eastern and southern suburbs (such as Earley and Woodley) lie within neighbouring local authorities.\nFuture cities[edit]\nDunfermline styles itself \"A Twinned City\" on the signs welcoming visitors to the town.[119] The area committee of Fife council is called City of Dunfermline Area Committee. It also has \"city centre\" rather than \"town centre\" written on its road signs.\nColchester in Essex lays claim to being the first city founded in Britain under the Romans in AD43. The city of Colchester was one of three destroyed in AD61 by Queen Boudica of the Iceni during her revolt against the Roman Empire. Despite making several attempts to become the first city in the county, it was eventually beaten by the county town Chelmsford in 2012. Today, Colchester is one of the fastest-growing boroughs in the country and the largest non-metropolitan district in the county of Essex with an estimated 187,000 people.\nIn its planning, the government of the day intended Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, to be a \"new city\" in scale, and it was referred to as such in contemporary supporting papers, but was gazetted in 1967 as a New Town. It has used the term \"City Centre\" on its buses for many years, and Milton Keynes as a whole is referred to as a city by many residents, the local council, and local organizations; one reason as to why this is done is to avoid confusion with the centres of its pre-existing constituent towns.\nSee also[edit]\nList of cities in the United Kingdom\nBorough status in the United Kingdom\nList of towns in the United Kingdom\nList of place names with royal patronage in the United Kingdom\nList of urban areas in the United Kingdom\nCity status in Ireland\nList of smallest cities in the United Kingdom\n\u00a0Cities portal\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"'I will tell my grandchildren': Southend celebrates city status | Southend-on-Sea\".

This association between having an Anglican cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when King Henry VIII founded dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and granted them city status by issuing letters patent.\nEngland and Walesdiocesan cathedralsAnglicancathedralKing Henry VIIIsee cityletters patentCity status in Ireland was granted to far fewer communities than in England and Wales, and there are only two pre-19th-century cities in present-day Northern Ireland. In Scotland, city status did not explicitly receive any recognition by the state until the 19th century. At that time, a revival of grants of city status took place, first in England, where the grants were accompanied by the establishment of new cathedrals, and later in Scotland and Ireland. In the 20th century, it was explicitly recognised that the status of city in England and Wales would no longer be bound to the presence of a cathedral, and grants made since have been awarded to communities on a variety of criteria, including population size.\nCity status in IrelandNorthern IrelandThe abolition of some corporate bodies as part of successive local-government reforms, beginning with the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, has deprived some ancient cities of their status. However, letters patent have been issued for most of the affected cities to ensure the continuation or restoration of their status. At present, Rochester and Elgin are the only former cities in the United Kingdom. The name \"City\" does not, in itself, denote city status; it may be appended to place names for historic association (e.g. White City) or for marketing or disambiguation (e.g. Stratford City). A number of large towns (such as those with over 200,000 residents) in the UK are bigger than some small cities, but cannot legitimately call themselves cities without the royal designation.[citation

of Britain were the fortified settlements organised by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the \"28 Cities\" (Old Welsh: cair) which was mentioned by Gildas[8] and listed by Nennius.[9]\nLatincivitascivitasBritainRomansCeltic tribesRoman ruleBritishclericsearly Middle Ages28 CitiesOld WelshcaircairGildas[8][8]Nennius[9][9]In the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city by the English Crown if it had a diocesan cathedral within its limits, for which 22 dioceses existed in England & Wales (see City status conferment further in the article). This association between having a cathedral and being called a city was established when Henry VIII founded new dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and also granted them city status by issuing letters patent,[10] demonstrating these were discrete procedures. Some cities today are very small because they were granted city status in or before the 16th century, then were unaffected by population growth during the Industrial Revolution\u2014notably Wells (population about 10,000) and St Davids (population about 2,000). After the 16th century, no new dioceses (and no new cities) were created until the 19th century in England (a further city was created in Ireland during the rule of King James I in the 17th century).\ndiocesan cathedralCity status confermentHenry VIIIsee cityletters patent[10][10]Industrial RevolutionWellsSt Davidsa further city was created1836\u20131888[edit]1836\u20131888[edit][edit]A long-awaited resumption of creating dioceses began in 1836 with Ripon. Ripon Town Council assumed that this had elevated the town to the rank of a city, and started referring to itself as the City and Borough of Ripon. The next diocese formed was Manchester and its Borough Council began informally to use the title city. When Queen Victoria visited Manchester in 1851, widespread doubts surrounding its status were raised. The pretension was ended when the borough petitioned for city status, which was granted by letters patent in 1853. This eventually forced Ripon to regularise its position; its city status was recognised by Act of Parliament in 1865. From this year Ripon bore city status whilst the rapidly expanding conurbation of Leeds \u2013 in the Ripon diocese \u2013 did not. The Manchester case established a precedent that any municipal borough in which an Anglican see was established was entitled to petition for city status.

In one new diocese, Southwell, a city was not created, because it was a village without a borough corporation and therefore could not petition the Queen. The diocese covered the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and the boroughs of Derby and Nottingham were disappointed that they would not be able to claim the title of city.[11]\nHome OfficeSt AlbansWakefieldSouthwelldioceseDerbyshireNottinghamshireDerbyNottingham[11][11]1889\u20131907[edit]1889\u20131907[edit][edit] Birmingham was the first English town without an Anglican cathedral to be granted city status.

At the time of the grant, Birmingham lacked an Anglican cathedral, although the parish church later became a cathedral in 1905. This new precedent was followed by other large municipalities: Leeds and Sheffield became cities in 1893, and Bradford, Kingston upon Hull and Nottingham were honoured on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The last three had been the largest county boroughs outside the London area without city status.[11]\nBirminghampre-empted in Ireland by Belfastthe parish churchLeedsSheffieldBradfordKingston upon HullNottinghamDiamond Jubileecounty boroughs[11][11]Between 1897 and 1914, applications were received from a number of other boroughs, but only Cardiff was successful in being designated a city in 1905 and granted a Lord Mayoralty as \"the Metropolis of Wales\".\nCardiffLord MayoraltyThe status of Westminster[edit]The status of Westminster[edit][edit]The London Government Act 1899 abolished the existing local authorities within the County of London and replaced them with 28 metropolitan boroughs. Among the bodies to be dissolved was the Court of Burgesses of the City of Westminster. William Burdett-Coutts, one of Westminster's members of parliament, brought forward an amendment to rename the proposed borough of Greater Westminster to City of Westminster. This was intended to give \"recognition to the title which the area ... had possessed for over three and a half centuries\". He felt that if the status was not retained for the new borough it \"must necessarily disappear altogether\". The amendment was rejected by the government, however, with the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour, believing it would be \"an anomaly which, I think, would be not unnaturally resented by other districts which are as large in point of population as Westminster, although doubtless not so rich in historical associations\".[12][13] The government eventually relented, with Balfour stating that \"as soon as the necessary arrangements under the London Government Act have been completed, there will be conferred on the borough of Westminster, as constituted under the Act, the title of city, originally conferred in the time of Henry VIII\".[14][15] Letters patent were duly issued granting the title of \"city\" to the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.[16]\nLondon Government Act 1899County of Londonmetropolitan boroughsCourt of BurgessesCity of WestminsterWilliam Burdett-CouttsCity of WestminsterCity of WestminsterFirst Lord of the TreasuryArthur Balfour[12][12][13][13][14][14][15][15]Letters patentMetropolitan Borough of Westminster[16][16]1907\u20131953[edit]1907\u20131953[edit][edit]In 1907, the Home Office and King Edward VII agreed on a policy that future applicants would have to meet certain criteria. This policy, which was not at the time made public, had the effect of stemming the number of city creations.\nKing Edward VIIThe 1907 policy contained three criteria:\nA minimum population of 300,000.\nA \"local metropolitan character\"\u2014this implied that the town had a distinct identity of its own and was the centre of a wider area.\nA good record of local government.[11]A minimum population of 300,000.A \"local metropolitan character\"\u2014this implied that the town had a distinct identity of its own and was the centre of a wider area.A good record of local government.[11][11][11]However, well into the 20th century it was often assumed that the presence of a cathedral was sufficient to elevate a town to city status, and that for cathedral cities the city charters were recognising its city status rather than granting it. On this basis, the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica said that Southwell and St Asaph were cities.\n1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia BritannicaEncyclop\u00e6dia BritannicaSouthwellSt AsaphThe policy laid down by Edward VII was continued by his successor, George V, who ascended the throne in 1910. In 1911, an application for city status by Portsmouth was refused. Explaining the Home Secretary's reason for not recommending the King to approve the petition, the Lord Advocate stated:\nGeorge VPortsmouthHome SecretaryLord Advocate...during the reign of his late Majesty it was found necessary, in order to maintain the value of the distinction, to lay down a rule as to the minimum population which should ordinarily, in connexion with other considerations, be regarded as qualifying a borough for that higher status.[17][18]...during the reign of his late Majesty it was found necessary, in order to maintain the value of the distinction, to lay down a rule as to the minimum population which should ordinarily, in connexion with other considerations, be regarded as qualifying a borough for that higher status.[17][18][17][17][18][18]Following the First World War, the King made an official visit to Leicester in 1919 to commemorate its contributions to the military victory. The borough council had made several applications for city status since 1889, and took the opportunity of the visit to renew its request. Leicester had a population of approximately 230,000 at the previous census, but its petition was granted as an exception to the policy, as it was officially a restoration of a dignity lost in the past.[19] When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent applied for city status in 1925, it was initially refused as it had only 294,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, however, as it was felt to have outstanding importance as the centre of the pottery industry. The effective relaxation of the population rule led to applications from Portsmouth and Salford. The civil servants in the Home Office were minded to refuse both applications. In particular, Salford was felt to be \"merely a scratch collection of 240,000 people cut off from Manchester by the river\". Salford's case, however, was considered favourably by the Home Secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, who had once been a Member of Parliament (MP) for a neighbouring constituency of Manchester North West. Following protests from Portsmouth, which felt it had better credentials as a larger town and as the \"first Naval Port of the kingdom\", both applications were approved in 1926.[11]\nFirst World WarLeicesterLeicester[19][19]Stoke-on-TrentPortsmouthSalfordSalfordWilliam Joynson-HicksMember of ParliamentManchester North WestPortsmouth[11][11]In 1927, a Royal Commission on Local Government was examining local council areas and functions in England and Wales. The question arose as to which towns were entitled to be called cities, and the chairman, the Earl of Onslow, wrote to the Home Office to seek clarification. The Home Office replied with a memorandum that read:\nRoyal Commission on Local GovernmentEarl of OnslowHome OfficeThe title of a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction. It has no connexion with the status of the borough in respect of local government and confers no powers or privileges. At the present time and for several centuries past the title has been obtained only by an express grant from the Sovereign effected by letters patent; but a certain number of cities possess the title by very ancient prescriptive right. There is no necessary connexion between the title of a city and the seat of a bishopric, and the creation of a new see neither constitutes the town concerned a city nor gives it any claim to the grant of letters patent creating it a city.[20]The title of a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction.

As the borough had more inhabitants than Portsmouth and had absorbed Devonport and East Stonehouse, the King agreed to the request. However, he indicated that he had \"come to an end of city making\", and Southampton's application in the following year was turned down.[11] The next city to be created was Lancaster in 1937 as part of the celebrations of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. With a population of a little over 50,000, Lancaster was stated to be an exception due to the town's \"long association with the crown\" and because it was \"the county town of the King's Duchy of Lancaster\". Following the Second World War, members of Cambridge Borough Council made contact with Lancaster officials for assistance in their application. Cambridge became a city in 1951, again for \"exceptional\" reasons, as the only ancient seat of learning in the kingdom not a city or royal burgh and to coincide with the 750th anniversary of the borough's first charter of incorporation.[21] Croydon also applied in 1951, but failed as it was felt not to have a sufficient identity apart from Greater London, and reports on the conduct of local government in the town were unfavourable.[11]\nPlymouthPortsmouthDevonportEast StonehouseSouthampton's[11][11]Lancastercoronation of King George VI and Queen ElizabethLancasterSecond World WarCambridgeLancasterCambridgeroyal burgh[21][21]CroydonGreater London[11][11]1953\u20131974[edit]1953\u20131974[edit][edit]It was anticipated that the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 would lead to the creation of a city, and Wolverhampton, Preston and Southampton made approaches; the only civic honour given was that of a lord mayoralty to Coventry. Derby and Southwark made unsuccessful applications in 1955. The planned reorganisations by the Local Government Commissions for England and Wales from 1958 effectively blocked new city grants. Southampton lodged a petition in 1958. Initially refused in 1959, pending the decision of the commission, it was eventually allowed in 1964.[22] In the meantime, the administration of London was reformed under the London Government Act 1963. While the City of London was permitted to continue in existence largely unchanged, Westminster was merged with two neighbouring authorities to form a new London borough from 1 April 1965.[23] In December 1963 it was announced that a charter was to be granted incorporating the new authority as \"Westminster\", and that the Queen had accepted the advice of the Home Secretary to raise the London borough to the title and dignity of city.[24] This example, of a successor local authority to a merged local government entity taking on that former entity's city status, was to be replicated in many instances as a result of the 1972/74 local government reforms across England and Wales (see below).\nElizabeth IIWolverhamptonPrestonSouthamptonCoventryDerbySouthwarkLocal Government Commissions for EnglandWalesSouthampton[22][22]London Government Act 1963City of LondonWestminsterLondon borough[23][23][24][24]With the establishment of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England in 1966, city grants were again in abeyance in England. Attempts by Derby, Teesside and Wolverhampton to become cities were not proceeded with. In Wales, Swansea campaigned for city status throughout the 1960s. The campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1969, in conjunction with the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales.[25]\nRoyal Commission on Local Government in EnglandDerbyTeessideWolverhamptonSwanseaCharles, Prince of Wales[25][25]1974 reorganisation and new cities[edit]1974 reorganisation and new cities[edit][edit]The Local Government Act 1972 abolished all existing local authorities outside London (other than parish councils) in England and Wales. This meant that the various local authorities that held city status ceased to exist on 1 April 1974.[26] To preserve city status new letters patent were issued to the most relevant metropolitan borough, non-metropolitan district or successor parish councils created by the Act.[27] Some of these came to cover local government districts many times wider than the previous city, even taking in many square miles of rural land outside the urban areas, for example the cities of Bradford, Leeds and Winchester. Three non-local authority preservations arose: here charter trustees were established for the cities of Lichfield and Salisbury (or New Sarum) being neither districts nor civil parishes, and special letters patent for a time preserved the city of Rochester.[28]\nLocal Government Act 1972parish councils[26][26]metropolitan boroughnon-metropolitan districtsuccessor parish[27][27]BradfordLeedsWinchestercharter trusteesLichfieldSalisburyRochester[28][28]In 1977, as part of the celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the Home Office identified nine candidates for city status: Blackburn, Brighton, Croydon, Derby, Dudley, Newport, Sandwell, Sunderland and Wolverhampton.[11] Ultimately, Derby received the award as the largest non-metropolitan district not already designated a city.[29] In April 1980 a parish council was created for Lichfield, and the charter trustees established six years earlier were dissolved. City status was temporarily lost until new letters patent were issued in November of the same year.[30] In 1992, on the fortieth anniversary of the monarch's accession, it was announced that another town would be elevated to a city. An innovation on this occasion was that a competition was to be held, and communities would be required to submit applications. Sunderland was the successful applicant.[31] This was followed in 1994 by the restoration of the dignity to St David's, historic see of a bishop.[32] Since 2000, city status has been awarded to towns or local government districts by competition on special occasions. A large number of towns have applied for the honour in recent decades including Blackpool, Colchester, Croydon, Gateshead, Ipswich, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Reading, Swindon and Warrington. Four successful applicants in England have become cities, as well as two in Wales; in 2000 for the Millennium celebrations, the new cities were Brighton and Hove and Wolverhampton; in 2002 for the Queen's Golden Jubilee it was Preston and Newport, and in 2012 for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee it was Chelmsford and St Asaph.[33][34][35][36]\nSilver Jubilee of Elizabeth IIBlackburnBrightonCroydonDerbyDudleyNewportSandwellSunderlandWolverhampton[11][11]Derby[29][29][30][30][31][31]St David's[32][32]BlackpoolColchesterCroydonGatesheadIpswichMiddlesbroughMilton KeynesReadingSwindonWarringtonBrighton and HoveWolverhamptonPrestonNewportChelmsfordSt Asaph[33][33][34][34][35][35][36][36]2021 bids for city status[edit]2021 bids for city status[edit][edit]Main article: Platinum Jubilee Civic HonoursPlatinum Jubilee Civic HonoursFrom June 2021, submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2022.

In England, Milton Keynes, Colchester and Doncaster were to be the recipients of the honour. Dunfermline, a previous royal capital of Scotland, was granted the privilege. Bangor in Northern Ireland was also a recipient, and the title in Wales was granted to Wrexham. Once these locations receive their letters patents later in 2022, this will increase the number of official mainland cities to 76, with 55 in England, eight in Scotland, seven in Wales, six in Northern Ireland. Outside the UK, Stanley, in the Falklands Islands, as well as Douglas, in the Isle of Man, were given the status, which will take the total to four cities after confirmations, with one in the Crown Dependencies and three in British Overseas Territories.[47]\ntotal to four cities[47][47]Greater London[edit]Greater London[edit][edit]Other than the cities of London and Westminster, no local authorities in the Greater London area have been granted city status. The Home Office had a policy of resisting any attempt by metropolitan boroughs to become cities even when their populations, and other proposed claims as qualifying criteria, might otherwise have made them eligible. It was felt that such a grant would undermine the status of the two existing cities in the capital. The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark made a number of applications, but in 1955 the borough's town clerk was told not to pursue the matter any further.[11] Outside the boundaries of the county, the County Borough of Croydon made three applications, all of which were dismissed as it was not seen as being sufficiently separate from London. When the successor London Borough of Croydon applied in 1965 the Assistant Under Secretary of State summarised the case against Croydon: \"...whatever its past history, it is now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs\".[11]\nLondonWestminsterGreater LondonMetropolitan Borough of Southwark[11][11]County Borough of CroydonLondon Borough of Croydon[11][11]The same objections were made when the London Boroughs of Croydon and Southwark unsuccessfully entered the competition for city status to mark the millennium: Croydon was said to have \"no particular identity of its own\" while Southwark was \"part of London with little individual identity\".[11] When the competition was held to mark the Golden Jubilee of 2002, Croydon made a sixth application, again unsuccessful. It was joined by the London Borough of Greenwich, which emphasised its royal and maritime connections, while claiming to be \"to London what Versailles is to Paris\".[11] In this vein Greenwich joined Kingston-upon-Thames and Kensington and Chelsea in London in having the title of Royal Borough in 2012.[48]\nLondon Boroughs of CroydonSouthwarkCroydonSouthwark[11][11]CroydonLondon Borough of GreenwichVersailles[11][11]GreenwichKingston-upon-ThamesKensington and Chelsea[48][48]Rochester[edit]Rochester[edit][edit]Rochester was recognised as a city from 1211 to 1998. On 1 April 1974, the city council was abolished, becoming part of the Borough of Medway, a local government district in the county of Kent. However, under letters patent the former city council area was to continue to be styled the \"City of Rochester\" to \"perpetuate the ancient name\" and to recall \"the long history and proud heritage of the said city\".[49] The city was unique, as it had no council or charter trustees and no mayor or civic head. In 1979, the Borough of Medway was renamed as Rochester-upon-Medway, and in 1982 further letters patent transferred the city status to the entire borough.[50] On 1 April 1998, the existing local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham were abolished and became the new unitary authority of Medway. Since it was the local government district that officially held city status under the 1982 letters patent, when it was abolished, it also ceased to be a city. Whilst the two other local government districts with city status (Bath and Hereford) that were abolished around this time decided to appoint charter trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty, Rochester-upon-Medway City Council did not do so. Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, they discovered that Rochester was not on the Lord Chancellor's Office's list of cities.[51][52] In 2010, it started to refer to the \"City of Medway\" in promotional material, but it was rebuked and instructed not to do so in future by the Advertising Standards Authority.[53]\nRochesterBorough of Medwaylocal government districtKentletters patent[49][49]Borough of MedwayRochester-upon-Medway[50][50]Gillinghamunitary authorityMedwayBathHerefordcharter trusteesRochesterLord Chancellor's Office[51][51][52][52]Advertising Standards Authority[53][53]Scotland[edit]Scotland[edit][edit]Scotland had no cities by royal charter or letters patent before 1889.[54] The nearest equivalent in pre-Union Scotland was the royal burgh. The term city was not always consistently applied, and there were doubts over the number of officially designated cities. The royal burghs of Edinburgh and Perth anciently used the title civitas, but the term city does not seem to have been used before the 15th century. Unlike the situation in England, in Scotland there was no link between the presence of a cathedral and the title of city. Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh were accepted as cities by ancient usage by the 18th century, while Perth and Elgin also used the title.[11] In 1856, the burgh of Dunfermline resolved to use the title of city in all official documents in the future, based on long usage and its former status as a royal capital. The status was never officially recognised.[11]\nroyal charter[54][54]royal burghcityEdinburghPerthcivitascitycityAberdeenGlasgowEdinburghPerthElgin[11][11]Dunfermlinecity[11][11]In 1889, Dundee was granted city status by letters patent. The grant by formal document led to doubts about the use of the title city by other burghs. In 1891, the city status of Aberdeen was confirmed when the burgh was enlarged by local Act of Parliament. The Royal Burgh of Inverness applied for promotion to a city as part of the Jubilee honours in 1897. The request was not granted, partly because it would draw attention to the lack of any charter granting the title to existing cities.[11] Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow were constituted \"counties of cities\" by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. The Act made no statement on the title city for any other burgh. In 1969, the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, stated that there were six cities in Scotland (without naming them) and Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Elgin, Glasgow and Perth were the only burghs listed as cities in 1972.[11][55]\nDundeecityAberdeenInverness[11][11]AberdeenDundeeEdinburghGlasgowLocal Government (Scotland) Act 1929cityJames CallaghanAberdeenDundeeEdinburghElginGlasgowPerth[11][11][55][55]The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 completely reorganised Scotland's local administration in 1975. All burghs were abolished, and a system of districts created. The four districts of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow had City included in their titles by the Act. The 1975 districts were replaced with the present council areas in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, and the same four cities were designated. Since the 1996 reorganisation, three more Scottish cities have been designated: Inverness as part of the millennium celebrations, Stirling in 2002 to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee and Perth in 2012 to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.[36] In the case of these three cities, there are no city councils and no formal boundaries. In January 2008, a petition to matriculate armorial bearings for the City of Inverness was refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms on the grounds that there is no corporate body or legal persona to whom arms can be granted.[56]\nLocal Government (Scotland) Act 1973AberdeenEdinburghDundeeGlasgowCityLocal Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994StirlingQueen Elizabeth II's Golden JubileePerthQueen's Diamond Jubilee[36][36]armorial bearingsLord Lyon King of Arms[56][56]Ireland and Northern Ireland[edit]Ireland and Northern Ireland[edit][edit]See also: City status in IrelandCity status in IrelandCity status in Ireland tended historically to be granted by royal charter. There are many towns in Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that have never been called cities. In spite of this, Armagh was considered a city, by virtue of its being the seat of the Primate of All Ireland, until the abolition of Armagh's city corporation by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. The only historic city with a charter in present-day Northern Ireland is Derry. Derry was given its first charter by James I in 1604, but the garrison was attacked and destroyed by Cahir O'Doherty in 1608.[57] The present city is the result of a second charter granted in 1613 to members of the London guilds, as part of the Plantation of Ulster, providing for the building of a walled city, which was renamed Londonderry.[58]\nChurch of IrelandArmaghPrimate of All IrelandMunicipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840DerryJames Iattacked and destroyedCahir O'Doherty[57][57]Plantation of UlsterLondonderry[58][58]In 1887, the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria was celebrated, and the Borough of Belfast submitted a memorial to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland seeking city status. Belfast based its claim on its similarity to two English boroughs that had received the honour\u2014the seaport of Liverpool and the textile centre of Manchester\u2014and the fact that it had (at the time) a larger population than the City of Dublin. Following some legal debate, city status was conferred in 1888. The grant of the honour on the grounds of being a large industrial town, rather than a diocesan centre, was unprecedented. Belfast's example was soon followed by Birmingham in England and Dundee in Scotland.[11]\nQueen VictoriaLord Lieutenant of IrelandLiverpoolManchesterDublinBelfast'sBirminghamDundee[11][11]In 1994, Armagh's city status was restored.[32] In 2002, Lisburn and Newry were two of the five towns in the UK that were granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II to mark her Golden Jubilee. In the case of Lisburn, the status extends to the entire local government district.[59] Newry, like Inverness and Stirling in Scotland, has no formal boundaries or city council. The letters patent were presented to representatives of Newry and Mourne District Council on behalf of the city.[60]\nArmagh's[32][32]LisburnNewryQueen Elizabeth IILisburn[59][59]NewryInvernessStirlingNewry and Mourne District Council[60][60]Crown colonies and British Overseas Territories[edit]Crown colonies and British Overseas Territories[edit][edit]During the British Empire, the Colonial Office had the power to declare cities in Crown colonies by letters patent when appointing bishops. When the Bishop of Guyana was created in 1842, Georgetown (then part of British Guiana) was officially declared the \"City of Georgetown\". The same process was followed for Gibraltar, Jamestown, St Helena, Bridgetown, Barbados, St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda, Victoria, Hong Kong and Nassau, Bahamas.[11]  Most of these have since gained independence from the United Kingdom, but Gibraltar and St Helena remain British Overseas Territories.

There is also a Lord Mayor of Cork, a title granted in 1900 when Cork was part of the (then) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nRepublic of IrelandDublinLord Mayor of DublinDublinKingdom of IrelandLord Mayor of CorkCorkUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and IrelandIn modern practice, competitions are held for cities that wish to gain the distinction of a lord mayor. The 2002 competition was entered by Bath, Cambridge, Carlisle, Chichester, Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Lancaster, Lincoln, St Albans, St Davids, Salford, Southampton, Sunderland, Truro, Wolverhampton and Worcester; the successful candidate was Exeter.[64] In 2012 a further competition was held, as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, with Armagh receiving the distinction.[65] Other than Armagh, eleven cities had entered the contest in 2012, namely: Cambridge, Derby, Gloucester, Lancaster, Newport, Peterborough, Salford, Southampton, St Albans, Sunderland, and Wakefield.[66]\nBathCambridgeCarlisleChichesterDerbyExeterGloucesterLancasterLincolnSt AlbansSt DavidsSalfordSouthamptonSunderlandTruroWolverhamptonWorcesterExeter[64][64]Diamond JubileeArmagh[65][65]NewportPeterboroughWakefield[66][66]Local government districts[edit]Local government districts[edit][edit]Since local government reorganisation in 1974 city status has been awarded to a number of local government districts which are not themselves towns. Each includes a number of towns and villages outside the urban area from which the district takes its name. In some of these cases city status was awarded to districts where the largest settlement had city status before 1974. In other cases a borough was formed to govern an area covering several towns and then city status was granted to the borough. The largest \"city\" district in terms of area is the City of Carlisle, which covers some 400 square miles (1,000\u00a0km2) of mostly rural landscape in the north of England, and is larger than smaller counties such as Merseyside or Rutland. Such cities include:\nCity of Carlisle2MerseysideRutlandCity of Bradford, including the towns of Bingley, Ilkley, Keighley and Shipley as well as Bradford\nCity of Canterbury, including the towns of Herne Bay and Whitstable as well as Canterbury\nCity of Lancaster, including the towns of Carnforth, Heysham and Morecambe as well as Lancaster and surrounding rural areas.\nCity of Leeds, including the towns of Otley, Pudsey and Wetherby as well as Leeds\nCity of Peterborough, including rural areas as well as Peterborough\nCity of Preston, including rural areas as well as Preston\nCity of St Albans, including the town of Harpenden as well as St Albans\nCity of Salford, including the towns of Eccles, Pendlebury and Swinton as well as Salford\nCity of Sunderland, including the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring and Washington as well as Sunderland\nCity of Wakefield, including the towns of Castleford, Ossett and Pontefract as well as Wakefield\nCity of Winchester, including the towns of Bishop's Waltham and New Alresford as well as WinchesterCity of Bradford, including the towns of Bingley, Ilkley, Keighley and Shipley as well as BradfordCity of BradfordBingleyIlkleyKeighleyShipleyBradfordCity of Canterbury, including the towns of Herne Bay and Whitstable as well as CanterburyCity of CanterburyHerne BayWhitstableCanterburyCity of Lancaster, including the towns of Carnforth, Heysham and Morecambe as well as Lancaster and surrounding rural areas.City of LancasterCarnforthHeyshamMorecambeLancasterCity of Leeds, including the towns of Otley, Pudsey and Wetherby as well as LeedsCity of LeedsOtleyPudseyWetherbyLeedsCity of Peterborough, including rural areas as well as PeterboroughCity of PeterboroughPeterboroughCity of Preston, including rural areas as well as PrestonCity of PrestonPrestonCity of St Albans, including the town of Harpenden as well as St AlbansCity of St AlbansHarpendenSt AlbansCity of Salford, including the towns of Eccles, Pendlebury and Swinton as well as SalfordCity of SalfordEcclesPendleburySwintonSalfordCity of Sunderland, including the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring and Washington as well as SunderlandCity of SunderlandHetton-le-HoleHoughton-le-SpringWashingtonSunderlandCity of Wakefield, including the towns of Castleford, Ossett and Pontefract as well as WakefieldCity of WakefieldCastlefordOssettPontefractWakefieldCity of Winchester, including the towns of Bishop's Waltham and New Alresford as well as WinchesterCity of WinchesterBishop's WalthamNew AlresfordWinchesterThere are some cities where the local government district is in fact smaller than the historical or natural boundaries of the city. Examples include: Manchester, where the traditional area associated includes areas of the neighbouring authorities of Trafford, Tameside, Oldham, Bury and the City of Salford; Kingston upon Hull, where surrounding areas and villages that are effectively suburbs, such as Cottingham, come under East Riding of Yorkshire Council; Glasgow, where suburban areas of the city are located in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire; Wolverhampton and London.\nManchesterTraffordTamesideOldhamBuryCity of SalfordKingston upon HullCottinghamEast Riding of Yorkshire CouncilGlasgowEast DunbartonshireEast RenfrewshireNorth LanarkshireRenfrewshireSouth LanarkshireWest DunbartonshireWolverhamptonCity councils[edit]City councils[edit][edit]See also: List of cities in the United KingdomList of cities in the United KingdomThe holding of city status gives a settlement no special rights other than that of calling itself a \"city\". Nonetheless, this appellation carries its own prestige and, consequently, competitions for the status are hard-fought.\nHistorically, city status could only be granted to incorporated towns. The grant was specifically awarded to the relevant local government area such as a civil parish or borough. However, recent grants have used a looser wording, where the status is awarded to the \"town\". In most cases the \"town\" is held to be coterminous with the relevant local government area, such that the city status holder is the corporate body of the council. Examples include the Letters Patent awarded to the \"Towns of Brighton and Hove\", the \"Town of Wolverhampton\" and the \"Town of Newport in the County Borough of Newport\". In each case the existing borough council became the city council.\nincorporated townsBrighton and HoveWolverhamptonNewportCounty Borough of NewportMost cities have city councils, which have varying powers depending on the country and type of settlement.\nEngland[edit]England[edit][edit]Twelve of the 52 cities in England are in metropolitan counties and their city councils are single-tier metropolitan district councils. Outside the metropolitan counties thirteen cities are unitary authorities, and fourteen have ordinary district councils, which are subordinate to their local county council. In London the Westminster City Council functions as a London borough council, and the City of London Corporation is the council for the City of London. Eight smaller episcopal cities such as Ripon and Wells are neither local government districts nor within a 'local government district with city status', and have city councils which are parish councils, with limited powers. Two cities (Bath and Chester) have no city council, while Durham has a 'city' parish council \u2013 these however, maintain the status through charter trustees on behalf of their prior district areas which held city status before being abolished in 1996 and 2009.[67][68][69]\nmetropolitan countiesmetropolitan district councilsunitary authoritiesdistrict councilscounty councilWestminster City CouncilLondon boroughCity of London CorporationCity of LondonWellsparish councilsBathChesterDurham[67][67][68][68][69][69]Scotland[edit]Scotland[edit][edit]Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow are themselves council areas and have their own city councils. The cities of Perth, Stirling and Inverness are part of council areas which do not have city status, and have no city councils. Stirling Council's application for city status was specifically for the urban area of the (now former) Royal Burgh of Stirling and included proposed city boundaries which are much smaller than Stirling council area.\nAberdeenDundeeEdinburghGlasgowcouncil areasPerthStirlingInvernessStirling CouncilRoyal Burgh of StirlingStirling council areaWales[edit]Wales[edit][edit]Cardiff, Newport and Swansea are principal areas and have city councils.

There are twenty towns in England and Wales that were recognised as cities by \"ancient prescriptive right\"; none of these communities had been formally declared a city, but they had all used the title since \"time immemorial\", that is, before 3 September 1189, and had been granted some form of privilege such as freedoms by way of a charter or being given borough or corporation status.[11] A list of these ancient cities was produced by the Home Office in 1927[70] and were:\nletters patenttime immemorial[11][11]Home Office[70][70].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}\nBangor (Wales)\nBath\nCanterbury\nCarlisle\nChichester\nCoventry\nDurham\nEly\nExeter\nHereford\nLichfield\nLincoln\nCity of London\nNorwich\nRochester (status lost in 1998)\nSalisbury\nWells\nWinchester\nWorcester\nYork\nBangor (Wales)\nBath\nCanterbury\nCarlisle\nChichester\nCoventry\nDurham\nEly\nExeter\nHereford\nLichfield\nLincoln\nCity of London\nNorwich\nRochester (status lost in 1998)\nSalisbury\nWells\nWinchester\nWorcester\nYorkBangor (Wales)BathCanterburyCarlisleChichesterCoventryDurhamElyExeterHerefordLichfieldLincolnCity of LondonNorwichRochester (status lost in 1998)status lostSalisburyWellsWinchesterWorcesterYorkThese twenty cities were concurrent with 22 ancient diocese (pre-English Reformation) locations.[71] Bath and Wells being one diocese, the remaining three are in Wales:\nancient dioceseEnglish Reformation[71][71]Bath and WellsLlandaff \u2014 had not been incorporated as a borough or granted privileges so was not deemed a city.

All cities where a local government unit that holds that status is abolished have to be re-issued with letters patent reconfirming city status following local government reorganisation where that holder has been abolished. This process was followed by a number of cities since 1974, and York and Hereford's status was confirmed twice, in 1974 and again in the 1990s. Failure to do so leads to the loss of city status as happened at Rochester in 1998 (see above), and also previously in St David's and Armagh, although both of these latter have regained city status since losing it. These three had been cities since time immemorial before the loss of city status.\nYorkHerefordRochestersee aboveaboveSt David'sArmaghThe formal definition of a city has been disputed,[citation needed] in particular by inhabitants of towns that have been regarded as cities in the past such as Colchester, which was considered[by whom?] a city from Roman times until 1542,[citation needed] and Dunfermline,[citation needed] although neither are legally cities today. Additionally, although the Crown clearly has the right to bestow \"official\" city status, some[who?] have doubted the right of the Crown to define the word city in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] In informal usage, city can be used for large towns or conurbations that are not formally cities. The best-known example of this is London, which contains two cities (the City of London and the City of Westminster) but is not itself a city, as well as Milton Keynes which was often referred to as a city and was even planned as a \"new city\" but was not officially approved for grant of the status until 2022.\n[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededColchester[by whom?]by

is not an ideal measure. Population can vary based on the number and type of residences present, and has to be limited to an area. As mentioned earlier in the article, the official area of a city in the UK is typically the coverage up to a local government/council boundary,[76] there being a variety of council bodies. However, there are exceptions depending on the UK constituent country[77] and whether the council has since been abolished.\nPopulationmentioned earlier[76][76][77][77]since been abolishedSuch a boundary can typically contain a built up (urban) area, and a surrounding, less populated rural landscape. Inversely, the area of a city can be entirely built up, with that urban environment spilling over a boundary into another area which does not have city status. That wider urban area can still be considered in everyday parlance locally as a whole 'city' although it is not a formal designation.\nWith the 'square mile' City of London being in the middle of a huge urban area, it can be suggested that 'small' should be applied to only cities with minimal urban areas that have nearby surrounding areas of countryside and so is visibly representative of the term, Wells being more suitable in this regard as the smallest standalone city council area. Therefore, sizing can be interpreted in a number of ways, and below are top 5 lists of the smallest and largest cities ranked by population, city council area, and urban area.\nAll statistics are 2011 census figures.[78]\nPopulation is of the total residents in the city council area.

within their borders \u2013 Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Nottingham, Plymouth, Preston, Salford, Southampton, Southend-on-Sea, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, and Wolverhampton.[111]\nAnglicanBrighton and HoveCambridgeHullLancasterLeedsNottinghamPlymouthPrestonSalfordSouthamptonSouthend-on-SeaStoke-on-TrentSunderlandSwanseaWolverhampton[111][111]Bath Abbey was once a diocesan cathedral, as was Westminster Abbey briefly during the reign of Henry VIII. These cities retained their city status despite their cathedrals losing that status.\nBath AbbeyWestminster AbbeyHenry VIIIScotland[edit]Scotland[edit][edit]The national church of Scotland, the Church of Scotland, is presbyterian in governance (not recognising authority of bishops), and thus has high kirks rather than cathedrals. However, the pre-Reformation dioceses do have extant cathedrals, most notably at Glasgow and Aberdeen, which remain in use by the Church of Scotland and continue to bear the honorific title of cathedral. Others (such as that of St Andrews) are now in ruins.\nnational churchChurch of Scotlandpresbyterianhigh kirksReformationGlasgowAberdeenthat of St AndrewsAs noted above, both Perth and Elgin were recognised as cities before 1975 (Perth's city status was restored in 2012[112]). Additionally, five other pre-Reformation sees\u2014Brechin, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Kirkwall and St Andrews\u2014are often referred to as cities, notably in names associated with the settlements (e.g. Brechin City F.C., City Road in St Andrews). Dornoch, Fortrose, Lismore, Saddell and Whithorn also possess pre-Reformation cathedrals but have never been described as cities.\nPerthElgin[112][112]BrechinDunblaneDunkeldKirkwallSt AndrewsBrechin City F.C.St AndrewsDornochFortroseLismoreSaddellWhithornTowns with non-Church of Scotland, post-Reformation cathedrals which are not recognised as cities are Ayr (R.C.), Millport (Episcopal), Oban (R.C.), Motherwell (R.C.) and Paisley (R.C.). Of these, Ayr, Motherwell and Paisley have larger populations than Perth, Stirling and Inverness, and both Ayr and Paisley have formally made a bid for city status during the millennium competition.[113]\nAyrR.C.MillportEpiscopalObanMotherwellPaisleyAyrMotherwellPaisleyPerthStirlingInvernessAyrPaisley[113][113]Of settlements granted city status in the 21st century, Inverness (awarded 2001) possesses an Episcopal cathedral (1866), but none under the auspices of the Church of Scotland. Stirling (awarded 2002) has never had a cathedral of any kind. Perth (reinstated 2012) has an Episcopal cathedral dating from 1860, but no pre-Reformation establishment.\nInvernessStirlingPerthNorthern Ireland[edit]Northern Ireland[edit][edit]In Northern Ireland, as noted above, possession of a diocesan cathedral has never (except in the anomalous case of Armagh) been sufficient to attain this status. In addition, the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871.\nArmaghdisestablished in 1871In spite of this, the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica refers to Armagh (Armagh had lost city status in 1840) and Lisburn as cities. Armagh subsequently regained city status formally in 1994 and Lisburn achieved city status in 2002.\n1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia BritannicaEncyclop\u00e6dia BritannicaArmaghArmaghLisburnArmaghLisburnThere are four towns in Northern Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that do not have city status\u2014Clogher, Downpatrick, Dromore and Enniskillen. \nClogherDownpatrickDromoreEnniskillenNewry is the only city in Northern Ireland that does not have a Church of Ireland cathedral within its borders.\nNewryClaimants[edit]Claimants[edit][edit]A number of towns describe themselves as cities (at least in some contexts), despite not having the requisite Charter.\nBallymena in Northern Ireland has been known informally as \"The City of the Seven Towers\" since the nineteenth century.[114]\nThe community council for Brechin is called City of Brechin & District Community Council. The local football team is known as Brechin City F.C. (they were formed at a meeting on City Road in the town). Brechin also possesses a cathedral, and was the ancient seat of the see of Brechin.\nDunkeld, the see of a bishop until the seventeenth century is sometimes referred to as a city. A \"City Hall\" was built in 1877, since converted into a holiday accommodation.[115][116]\nThe community council for Elgin is called City and Royal Burgh of Elgin Community Council. The local football team is known as Elgin City F.C.\nGuildford possesses a cathedral and the local football team is named Guildford City F.C. In 2013 the local council did not submit an application, citing low chance of success, and high time and resource against low benefits ratio.[117]\nLetchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City are medium-sized New Towns in Hertfordshire established to reduce the overcrowding of London as part of the Garden city movement.\nAfter its unsuccessful attempts to gain city status, the town of Reading, Berkshire, started using the phrase \"City Centre\" on its buses[118] and car-park signs. Reading's urban area has in excess of 350,000 inhabitants, making it one of the largest urban areas in the UK and larger than many sizeable cities including Southampton, Kingston upon Hull and Derby.

Scotland portal \nOther countries\nvte\nFor local government purposes, Scotland is divided into 32 areas designated as \"council areas\" (Scottish Gaelic: comhairlean), which are all governed by unitary authorities designated as \"councils\".[1] They have the option under the Local Government (Gaelic Names) (Scotland) Act 1997[2] of being known (but not re-designated) as a \"comhairle\" when opting for a Gaelic name; only Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Council of the Western Isles) has chosen this option, whereas the Highland Council (Comhairle na G\u00e0idhealtachd) has adopted its Gaelic form alongside its English equivalent informally.\nThe council areas have been in existence since 1 April 1996, under the provisions of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. Historically, Scotland was divided into 34 counties or shires. Although these no longer have any administrative function, they are still used to some extent in Scotland for cultural and geographical purposes, and some of the current council areas are named after them. There are also a number of other administrative divisions, some of which are handled by joint boards of the councils.\nAt the most local level Scotland is divided into civil parishes, which are now used only for statistical purposes such as the census. The lowest level of administrative subdivision are the communities, which may elect community councils.\n\nContents\n\n1 History of the subdivisions of Scotland\n2 Council areas\n3 Other subdivisions\n\n3.1 Electoral and valuation\n3.2 Health\n3.3 Transport\n3.4 Eurostat NUTS\n3.5 Land registration\n3.6 Sheriffdoms\n3.7 Lieutenancy areas\n3.8 Former police and fire services\n\n\n4 Lower level subdivisions\n5 See also\n6 References\n\n\nHistory of the subdivisions of Scotland[edit]\nFurther information: Burgh \u00a7\u00a0History, and History of local government in Scotland\nTraditionally burghs have been the key unit of the local government of Scotland, being highly autonomous entities, with rights to representation in the old Parliament of Scotland. Even after the Acts of Union 1707, burghs continued to be the principal subdivision. Until 1889 administration was on a burgh and parish basis.\nThe years following 1889 saw the introduction of a hierarchy of local government administration comprising counties, counties of cities, large burghs and small burghs.\nWith effect from 16 May 1975 and until 31 March 1996 the local government divisions of Scotland consisted of an upper tier of regions each containing a lower tier of districts except for the single-tier island council areas. Since 1996 there has only been a single tier of government, and the former island council areas are of equal status to the other councils.\n\nCouncil areas[edit]\nThese are mid-year estimates for 2019 from the Office for National Statistics.\n\n\nRank\nCouncil area\nPopulation[3]\nElectors[4]\nArea (km2)[5]\nDensity(per km2)\n\n\n1\nGlasgow City\n626,410\n462,286\n174.7\n3,586\n\n\n2\nCity of Edinburgh\n518,500\n367,762\n263.4\n1,969\n\n\n3\nFife\n371,910\n280,622\n1,325\n281\n\n\n4\nNorth Lanarkshire\n340,180\n256,174\n469.9\n724\n\n\n5\nSouth Lanarkshire\n319,020\n248,875\n1,772\n180\n\n\n6\nAberdeenshire\n261,470\n202,194\n6,313\n41\n\n\n7\nHighland\n235,540\n184,697\n25,657\n9\n\n\n8\nAberdeen City\n227,560\n163,196\n185.7\n1,225\n\n\n9\nWest Lothian\n182,140\n137,614\n427.7\n426\n\n\n10\nRenfrewshire\n177,790\n133,295\n261.5\n680\n\n\n11\nFalkirk\n160,340\n122,471\n297.4\n539\n\n\n12\nPerth and Kinross\n151,290\n114,936\n5,286\n29\n\n\n13\nDumfries and Galloway\n148,790\n116,593\n6,427\n23\n\n\n14\nDundee City\n148,750\n112,513\n59.83\n2,486\n\n\n15\nNorth Ayrshire\n135,280\n107,763\n885.4\n153\n\n\n16\nEast Ayrshire\n121,840\n94,657\n1,262\n97\n\n\n17\nAngus\n116,040\n89,652\n2,182\n53\n\n\n18\nScottish Borders\n115,270\n91,919\n4,732\n24\n\n\n19\nSouth Ayrshire\n112,550\n90,300\n1,222\n92\n\n\n20\nEast Dunbartonshire\n108,330\n85,410\n174.5\n621\n\n\n21\nEast Lothian\n105,790\n80,874\n679.2\n156\n\n\n22\nMoray\n95,520\n73,284\n2,238\n43\n\n\n23\nEast Renfrewshire\n95,170\n71,618\n174.2\n546\n\n\n24\nStirling\n94,330\n68,778\n2,187\n43\n\n\n25\nMidlothian\n91,340\n70,587\n353.7\n258\n\n\n26\nWest Dunbartonshire\n89,130\n68,826\n158.8\n561\n\n\n27\nArgyll and Bute\n86,260\n68,271\n6,909\n12\n\n\n28\nInverclyde\n78,150\n59,941\n160.5\n487\n\n\n29\nClackmannanshire\n51,400\n39,186\n159.0\n323\n\n\n30\nNa h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles)\n26,830\n21,874\n3,059\n9\n\n\n31\nShetland\n22,990\n17,837\n1,468\n16\n\n\n32\nOrkney\n22,190\n17,135\n988.8\n22\n\nOther subdivisions[edit]\nScotland has several other administrative divisions, some of which are handled by joint boards of the councils.\n\nElectoral and valuation[edit]\nThere are several joint boards for electoral registration and the purposes of property valuation for assessing council tax and rates.[6]\n\n\n\nJoint board area\nCouncil areas\n\n\nAyrshire\nEast Ayrshire, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire\n\n\nBorders\n\nScottish Borders\n\n\nCentral Scotland\nClackmannanshire, Falkirk, Stirling\n\n\nDumfries and Galloway\n\nDumfries and Galloway\n\n\nDunbartonshire and Argyll & Bute\nArgyll and Bute, East Dunbartonshire, West Dunbartonshire\n\n\nFife\n\nFife\n\n\nGrampian\nAberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray\n\n\nGlasgow\n\nGlasgow\n\n\nHighlands and Western Isles\n\nHighland and Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles)\n\n\nLanarkshire\nNorth Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire\n\n\nLothian\nEast Lothian, Edinburgh, Midlothian, West Lothian\n\n\nOrkney and Shetland\n\nOrkney Islands and Shetland Islands\n\n\nRenfrewshire\nEast Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Renfrewshire\n\n\nTayside\nAngus, Dundee, Perth and Kinross\n\nHealth[edit]\nSee also NHS Scotland\n\n\n\nHealth board area\n\nCouncil areas\n\n\nAyrshire and Arran\n\nEast Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire\n\n\nBorders\n\nScottish Borders\n\n\nDumfries and Galloway\n\nDumfries and Galloway\n\n\nFife\n\nFife\n\n\nForth Valley\n\nClackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling\n\n\nGrampian\n\nAberdeenshire, City of Aberdeen and Moray\n\n\nGreater Glasgow and Clyde\n\nCity of Glasgow, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire,  Inverclyde, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire\n\n\nHighland\n\nArgyll and Bute and Highland\n\n\nLanarkshire\n\nNorth Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire\n\n\nLothian\n\nCity of Edinburgh, East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian\n\n\nOrkney\n\nOrkney Islands\n\n\nShetland\n\nShetland Islands\n\n\nTayside\n\nAngus, City of Dundee and Perth and Kinross\n\n\nWestern Isles (Eileanan Siar)\n\nWestern Isles (Na h-Eileanan Siar)\n\nUntil 1 April 2014 the towns of Cambuslang and Rutherglen were in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area despite being located in South Lanarkshire.

The areas are similar to the Historic Counties and the Registration Counties, but are not identical to either.  Most notably, the four cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow form separate areas from the surrounding countryside, with the Lord Provost of each city acting ex officio as the lord-lieutenant.\n\n\n\nLieutenancy areas of Scotland\n\n\n\nAberdeen\nAberdeenshire\nAngus\nArgyll and Bute\nAyrshire and Arran\nBanffshire\nBerwickshire\nCaithness\nClackmannanshire\nDumfries\nDunbartonshire\nDundee\nEast Lothian\nEdinburgh\nFife\nGlasgow\nInverness\nKincardineshire\nLanarkshire\nMidlothian\nMoray\nNairn\nPerth and Kinross\nRenfrewshire\nRoss and Cromarty\nRoxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale\nStirling and Falkirk\nSutherland\nThe Stewartry of Kirkcudbright\nTweeddale\nWest Lothian\nWestern Isles\nWigtown\nNot shown:\n\nOrkney\nShetland\n\n\n\nFormer police and fire services[edit]\nThe Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 resulted in the merger of local police and fire services on 1 April 2013 to form the Police Service of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: Seirbheis Phoilis na h-Alba) and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS, Scottish Gaelic: Seirbheis Sm\u00e0laidh agus Teasairginn na h-Alba).\nPrior to 1975 policing was the responsibility of the Cities and Burghs of Scotland (see List of burghs in Scotland).  Between 1975 and 2013 Scotland was subdivided into Police and fire service areas based on the regions and districts and island council areas that were also formed in 1975. The police and fire service regions used between 1975 and 2013 are listed below.\n\n\n\nServices\n\nOriginal area (former regions)\n\nCouncil areas\n\n\nCentral Scotland Police  Central Scotland Fire and Rescue Service\n\nCentral\n\nClackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling\n\n\nDumfries and Galloway Constabulary  Dumfries and Galloway Fire and Rescue Service\n\nDumfries and Galloway\n\nDumfries and Galloway\n\n\nFife Constabulary  Fife Fire and Rescue Service\n\nFife\n\nFife\n\n\nGrampian Police  Grampian Fire and Rescue Service\n\nGrampian\n\nAberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray\n\n\nLothian and Borders Police  Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service\n\nLothians and the Scottish Borders\n\nCity of Edinburgh, East Lothian, Midlothian, Scottish Borders, West Lothian\n\n\nNorthern Constabulary  Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service\n\nHighland, Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles\n\nHighland, Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles), Orkney  and Shetland\n\n\nStrathclyde Police  Strathclyde Fire and Rescue\n\nStrathclyde\n\nArgyll and Bute, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire  East Renfrewshire, the City of Glasgow, Inverclyde,  North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire,  South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire\n\n\nTayside Police  Tayside Fire and Rescue Service\n\nTayside\n\nAngus, the City of Dundee and Perth & Kinross\n\nLower level subdivisions[edit]\nSee also: Local government in Scotland\nScotland is divided into 871 civil parishes which often resemble same-named but legally different ecclesiastical parishes. Although they have had no administrative function since 1930, they still exist and are still used for statistical purposes such as the census. Many former civil parish areas also continued to form registration districts until 1 January 2007. Many boundary changes have occurred over the years and an area currently derived from an old parish might no longer contain a place previously within that parish. Similarly, county boundaries (as still used for land registration) have also changed over the years such that a parish mentioned historically (generally before the 1860s) as being in one county (or sometimes two due to straddling a border) might now be in a neighbouring county and consequentially in a different succeeding council area.\nFor most administrative purposes, the base level of sub-division in Scotland is now that of communities, which may elect community councils. The main role of these bodies is to channel and reflect local opinion to other bodies; they otherwise have very limited powers. There are around 1,200 communities in Scotland. Not all communities have councils; some have joint councils.\nScottish communities are the nearest equivalent to civil parishes in England.\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of articles about local government in the United Kingdom\nISO 3166-2:GB, subdivision codes for the United Kingdom\nScottish Parliament constituencies and regions\nScottish Westminster constituencies\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Local government facts and figures: Scotland\". lgiu.org.

\"council areas\" (Scottish Gaelic: comhairlean), which are all governed by unitary authorities designated as \"councils\".[1] They have the option under the Local Government (Gaelic Names) (Scotland) Act 1997[2] of being known (but not re-designated) as a \"comhairle\" when opting for a Gaelic name; only Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Council of the Western Isles) has chosen this option, whereas the Highland Council (Comhairle na G\u00e0idhealtachd) has adopted its Gaelic form alongside its English equivalent informally.\nlocal governmentScotlandScottish Gaeliccomhairleanunitary

provisions of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. Historically, Scotland was divided into 34 counties or shires. Although these no longer have any administrative function, they are still used to some extent in Scotland for cultural and geographical purposes, and some of the current council areas are named after them. There are also a number of other administrative divisions, some of which are handled by joint boards of the councils.\nLocal Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994counties or shiresAt the most local level Scotland is divided into civil parishes, which are now used only for statistical purposes such as the census. The lowest level of administrative subdivision are the communities, which may elect community councils.\ncivil parishescommunitiescommunity councilsContents\n\n1 History of the subdivisions of Scotland\n2 Council areas\n3 Other subdivisions\n\n3.1 Electoral and valuation\n3.2 Health\n3.3 Transport\n3.4 Eurostat NUTS\n3.5 Land registration\n3.6 Sheriffdoms\n3.7 Lieutenancy areas\n3.8 Former police and fire services\n\n\n4 Lower level subdivisions\n5 See also\n6 References\n\nContentsContents\n1 History of the subdivisions of Scotland\n2 Council areas\n3 Other subdivisions\n\n3.1 Electoral and valuation\n3.2 Health\n3.3 Transport\n3.4 Eurostat NUTS\n3.5 Land registration\n3.6 Sheriffdoms\n3.7 Lieutenancy areas\n3.8 Former police and fire services\n\n\n4 Lower level subdivisions\n5 See also\n6 References\n1 History of the subdivisions of Scotland1 History of the subdivisions of Scotland1History of the subdivisions of Scotland2 Council areas2 Council areas2Council areas3 Other subdivisions\n\n3.1 Electoral and valuation\n3.2 Health\n3.3 Transport\n3.4 Eurostat NUTS\n3.5 Land registration\n3.6 Sheriffdoms\n3.7 Lieutenancy areas\n3.8 Former police and fire services\n\n3 Other subdivisions3Other subdivisions\n3.1 Electoral and valuation\n3.2 Health\n3.3 Transport\n3.4 Eurostat NUTS\n3.5 Land registration\n3.6 Sheriffdoms\n3.7 Lieutenancy areas\n3.8 Former police and fire services\n3.1 Electoral and valuation3.1 Electoral and valuation3.1Electoral and valuation3.2 Health3.2 Health3.2Health3.3 Transport3.3 Transport3.3Transport3.4 Eurostat NUTS3.4 Eurostat NUTS3.4Eurostat NUTS3.5 Land registration3.5 Land registration3.5Land registration3.6 Sheriffdoms3.6 Sheriffdoms3.6Sheriffdoms3.7 Lieutenancy areas3.7 Lieutenancy areas3.7Lieutenancy areas3.8 Former police and fire services3.8 Former police and fire services3.8Former police and fire services4 Lower level subdivisions4 Lower level subdivisions4Lower level subdivisions5 See also5 See also5See also6 References6 References6ReferencesHistory of the subdivisions of Scotland[edit]History of the subdivisions of Scotland[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}Further information: Burgh \u00a7\u00a0History, and History of local government in ScotlandBurgh \u00a7\u00a0HistoryHistory of local government in ScotlandTraditionally burghs have been the key unit of the local government of Scotland, being highly autonomous entities, with rights to representation in the old Parliament of Scotland.

subdivisions[edit][edit]See also: Local government in ScotlandLocal government in ScotlandScotland is divided into 871 civil parishes which often resemble same-named but legally different ecclesiastical parishes. Although they have had no administrative function since 1930, they still exist and are still used for statistical purposes such as the census. Many former civil parish areas also continued to form registration districts until 1 January 2007. Many boundary changes have occurred over the years and an area currently derived from an old parish might no longer contain a place previously within that parish. Similarly, county boundaries (as still used for land registration) have also changed over the years such that a parish mentioned historically (generally before the 1860s) as being in one county (or sometimes two due to straddling a border) might now be in a neighbouring county and consequentially in a different succeeding council area.\n871 civil parishesregistration districtsFor most administrative purposes, the base level of sub-division in Scotland is now that of communities, which may elect community councils. The main role of these bodies is to channel and reflect local opinion to other bodies; they otherwise have very limited powers. There are around 1,200 communities in Scotland. Not all communities have councils; some have joint councils.\ncommunitiescommunity councilsScottish communities are the nearest equivalent to civil parishes in England.\ncivil parishesSee also[edit]See also[edit][edit]List of articles about local government in the United Kingdom\nISO 3166-2:GB, subdivision codes for the United Kingdom\nScottish Parliament constituencies and regions\nScottish Westminster constituenciesList of articles about local government in the United KingdomList of articles about local government in the United KingdomISO 3166-2:GB, subdivision codes for the United KingdomISO 3166-2:GBScottish Parliament constituencies and regionsScottish Parliament constituencies and regionsScottish Westminster constituenciesScottish Westminster constituenciesReferences[edit]References[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}\n\n^ \"Local government facts and figures: Scotland\". lgiu.org.

Glasgow, Scotland. The main block, which was the meeting place of the Royal Burgh of Glasgow, was demolished in 1921 leaving only the steeple standing. The steeple is a Category A listed building.[1]\n\nHistory[edit]\n The surviving steeple\nThe first tolbooth erected on the site at Glasgow Cross dated back at least to the mid-14th century.[2][3] After it became ruinous, construction work on a new tolbooth started in 1626.[4] It was designed by the master of the works, John Boyd, in the Scottish baronial style, built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1634.[1] The building was laid out in two parts: a five-storey main block and a seven-stage steeple at the east end.[1]\nThe design of the main block involved a symmetrical main frontage with six bays facing onto Trongate; the ground floor was rusticated with a series of openings, the first, second and third floors were fenestrated with rectangular windows with architraves while the fourth floor was fenestrated with segmental headed windows. The end bays on the fourth floor were flanked by bartizans and the roof line was castellated. The design of the steeple involved small leaded glass windows for each of the second to sixth stages and clock faces in the seventh stage, all surmounted by a corbelled parapet, a prominent crown spire and a weather vane.[1] The weather vane was gilded by the decorative painter, Valentine Jenkin.[5]\nThe building was used as a prison and courthouse in the 17th and 18th centuries: a total of 22 executions took place at the tolbooth over that period.[6] Covenanters who were held in the tolbooth in poor conditions in the 17th century[7][8] included Donald Cargill[9] and Robert Ker of Kersland.[10] The tolbooth also incorporated the burgh chambers and a tavern[11] and its steeple was 126 feet (38\u00a0m) high.[3]\nThe building continued in these uses until the authorities relocated to the new public offices in the Saltmarket in 1814.[12][13] After being sold for commercial use,[14] the tolbooth was renovated to a design by David Hamilton and was used as a drapery warehouse from 1874, before becoming the offices of a firm of auctioneers, John A. Bowman.[15][16] By the early 20th century the tolbooth was very dilapidated: after the main block had been demolished in 1921, essential repairs and modifications were made to the west face of the steeple, where the tolbooth had previously adjoined it, to a design by Keppie Henderson, in 1923.[4]\nOn 4 June 2021, a night time light projection onto the steeple was installed, under the Climate Clock initiative. The projected deadline and lifeline statistics counted the time window before 1.5 \u00b0C warming becomes inevitable, and the percentage of global energy delivered through renewables, respectively. This initiative was implemented in anticipation of the COP-26 summit in Glasgow in November 2021.[17]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of listed buildings in Glasgow/2\nList of Category A listed buildings in Glasgow\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d Historic Environment Scotland. \"High Street, Glasgow Cross, the Tolbooth Steeple (LB32717)\".

It also offers Merchant Navy officer training up to Chief Engineer and Master Mariner level. Up to 3,000 cadets study at the nautical faculty which in 2019 celebrated its 50th anniversary since opening.\nThe City Campus, situated on Cathedral Street in Glasgow, was officially opened by Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in 2016. The main contractor on both developments was Sir Robert McAlpine with architects Michael Laird and Reiach & Hall.\nBoth campuses were shortlisted for the RIBA Stirling Prize.[5]\n\nStudent association[edit]\n City Campus\nThis section does not cite any sources.

tallest tower in the world in which the whole structure is capable of rotating 360 degrees.[1]Websitewww.glasgowsciencecentre.org/discover/our-experiences/glasgow-tower\nGlasgow Tower (formerly the Millennium Tower)[2] is a 127 metres (417\u00a0ft) free-standing landmark observation tower located on the south bank of the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland and forms part of the Glasgow Science Centre complex. It holds a Guinness World Record for being the tallest fully rotating freestanding structure in the world, in which the whole structure is capable of rotating 360 degrees.[3] After being closed in 2008 for refurbishments, the tower re-opened to the general public in July 2014.\nThe Glasgow Tower has been the tallest building in both Glasgow and Scotland since its completion in 2001.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Background and world records\n2 History\n3 Design\n4 Tallest building debate\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nBackground and world records[edit]\nAt 127 metres (417\u00a0ft), the Glasgow Tower is currently the tallest tower in Scotland, and since late 2015 following the demolition of both the Red Road Flats and the Bluevale and Whitevale Towers the structure is now the tallest building in all of Glasgow.  It holds a Guinness World Record for being the tallest tower in the world in which the whole structure is capable of rotating 360 degrees.  The whole structure originally rested upon a Nigerian made 65-centimetre-diameter (26\u00a0in)  thrust bearing, but this was replaced with a phosphor-manganese-bronze alloy solid ball and cup bearing prior to re-opening in 2014. This bearing rests at the bottom of a 15-metre-deep (49\u00a0ft) caisson, while the tower itself is not directly connected to these foundations, instead being supported by a ring of 24 rubber-sprung roller bearings at Podium level. This is to allow the building to rotate to face into the wind.\nThe tower has two lifts each with a 12-person capacity, but for reasons of comfort, this is limited to 6 guests plus a single member of staff. The lifts, manufactured by Alimak Hek, ascend the tower in two and a half minutes using a rack and pinion system,[5] providing views to the rear of the tower through all-around glass windows. There is also an emergency staircase, comprising 523 stairs from the Cabin level to the Podium.[6]\n\nHistory[edit]\n Aerial view of Glasgow Tower\nThe tower has been plagued by safety and engineering problems throughout its history. It missed its opening date in 2001.[7] Problems with the Nigerian-made thrust bearing on which it rotates led to it being closed between February 2002 and August 2004.[8] On 30 January 2005, ten people were trapped in the lifts and the rescue took over five hours to complete.[9] Following the incident, the tower re-opened on 21 December 2006.[10]\nIn September 2007, a charity abseiling event was held on Glasgow Tower.[11][12] The Centre states that 65,000 people have climbed the tower during its periods of operation.[7]\nIn August 2010 the tower closed again due to \"technical issues stemming from its original design\".[7]\nPrior to re-opening in 2014, the thrust bearing was replaced with a ball and cup bearing, and the partial fix was featured in the TV documentary \"Incredible Engineering Blunders: Fixed\".[13]\nThe tower opened to the public again in July 2014 with new safety features and an updated interior.[14]  The tower now operates annually across the summer months (between April and October) and will take passengers to the 100 metres (330\u00a0ft) high observation deck when wind-speeds do not exceed approximately 11.2 metres per second (40\u00a0km/h; 25\u00a0mph), which ensures their comfort and enjoyment.\nThree days after opening, a capacitor bank at the base encountered a fault, producing smoke which was misidentified as a fire.\nThe tower has not opened during 2021, reportedly due to social distancing requirements.[15]\n\nDesign[edit]\nIt is shaped like an aerofoil (as if a symmetrical aircraft wing had been set in the ground vertically), with 4 manually-operated 6\u00a0kW motors to turn it into the wind in order to reduce wind resistance and improve stability through aerodynamic forces (wind split by the aerofoil applies an equal force to both sides of the structure, holding it in place). The tower, previously known as the Millennium Tower, was the winning design in an international competition to design a tower for the city centre of Glasgow.[16] The original architectural design was by the architect Richard Horden, with engineering design by Buro Happold, but after commissioning the project was taken over by the Glasgow architects BDP. In the end the tower cost \u00a310 million. Glasgow City Council successfully sued contractors Carillion over the quality of the work.[7]\n\nTallest building debate[edit]\n The tower as viewed from its base\nWhen completed in 2001, it became the second tallest self supporting structure in Scotland, behind the Inverkip Power Station chimney. The website for the tower claims it is \"The tallest freestanding building in Scotland\".[17] Although the tower has an observation deck at 330 feet (100\u00a0m),[18] it does not have floors continuously from the ground and therefore the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) does not consider it to be a building.\n\nSee also[edit]\nPortsmouth's stylistically similar Spinnaker Tower, England's tallest building outside London.\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ Science Centre Tower at Emporis\n\n^ https://www.visitglasgow.net/things-to-do/tourist-attractions/glasgow-tower\n\n^ \"Glasgow Tower | Glasgow Science Centre\". www.glasgowsciencecentre.org.

It holds a Guinness World Record for being the tallest fully rotating freestanding structure in the world, in which the whole structure is capable of rotating 360 degrees.[3] After being closed in 2008 for refurbishments, the tower re-opened to the general public in July 2014.\nGlasgow TowerMillennium Tower[2][2]observation towerRiver ClydeGlasgowGlasgow Science Centre[3][3]The Glasgow Tower has been the tallest building in both Glasgow and Scotland since its completion in 2001.[4]\n[4][4]Contents\n\n1 Background and world records\n2 History\n3 Design\n4 Tallest building debate\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\nContentsContents\n1 Background and world records\n2 History\n3 Design\n4 Tallest building debate\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n1 Background and world records1 Background and world records1Background and world records2 History2 History2History3 Design3 Design3Design4 Tallest building debate4 Tallest building debate4Tallest building debate5 See also5 See also5See also6 References6 References6References7 External links7 External links7External linksBackground and world records[edit]Background and world records[edit][edit]At 127 metres (417\u00a0ft), the Glasgow Tower is currently the tallest tower in Scotland, and since late 2015 following the demolition of both the Red Road Flats and the Bluevale and Whitevale Towers the structure is now the tallest building in all of Glasgow.  It holds a Guinness World Record for being the tallest tower in the world in which the whole structure is capable of rotating 360 degrees.  The whole structure originally rested upon a Nigerian made 65-centimetre-diameter (26\u00a0in)  thrust bearing, but this was replaced with a phosphor-manganese-bronze alloy solid ball and cup bearing prior to re-opening in 2014. This bearing rests at the bottom of a 15-metre-deep (49\u00a0ft) caisson, while the tower itself is not directly connected to these foundations, instead being supported by a ring of 24 rubber-sprung roller bearings at Podium level. This is to allow the building to rotate to face into the wind.\nRed Road FlatsBluevale and Whitevale Towersthe tallest building in all of Glasgowthrust bearingThe tower has two lifts each with a 12-person capacity, but for reasons of comfort, this is limited to 6 guests plus a single member of staff. The lifts, manufactured by Alimak Hek, ascend the tower in two and a half minutes using a rack and pinion system,[5] providing views to the rear of the tower through all-around glass windows. There is also an emergency staircase, comprising 523 stairs from the Cabin level to the Podium.[6]\nliftsAlimak Hekrack and pinion[5][5][6][6]History[edit]History[edit][edit] Aerial view of Glasgow Tower Aerial view of Glasgow TowerAerial view of Glasgow TowerThe tower has been plagued by safety and engineering problems throughout its history. It missed its opening date in 2001.[7] Problems with the Nigerian-made thrust bearing on which it rotates led to it being closed between February 2002 and August 2004.[8] On 30 January 2005, ten people were trapped in the lifts and the rescue took over five hours to complete.[9] Following the incident, the tower re-opened on 21 December 2006.[10]\n[7][7]thrust bearing[8][8][9][9][10][10]In September 2007, a charity abseiling event was held on Glasgow Tower.[11][12] The Centre states that 65,000 people have climbed the tower during its periods of operation.[7]\nabseiling[11][11][12][12][7][7]In August 2010 the tower closed again due to \"technical issues stemming from its original design\".[7]\n[7][7]Prior to re-opening in 2014, the thrust bearing was replaced with a ball and cup bearing, and the partial fix was featured in the TV documentary \"Incredible Engineering Blunders: Fixed\".[13]\n[13][13]The tower opened to the public again in July 2014 with new safety features and an updated interior.[14]  The tower now operates annually across the summer months (between April and October) and will take passengers to the 100 metres (330\u00a0ft) high observation deck when wind-speeds do not exceed approximately 11.2 metres per second (40\u00a0km/h; 25\u00a0mph), which ensures their comfort and enjoyment.\nThree days after opening, a capacitor bank at the base encountered a fault, producing smoke which was misidentified as a fire.\n[14][14]The tower has not opened during 2021, reportedly due to social distancing requirements.[15]\n[15][15]Design[edit]Design[edit][edit]It is shaped like an aerofoil (as if a symmetrical aircraft wing had been set in the ground vertically), with 4 manually-operated 6\u00a0kW motors to turn it into the wind in order to reduce wind resistance and improve stability through aerodynamic forces (wind split by the aerofoil applies an equal force to both sides of the structure, holding it in place). The tower, previously known as the Millennium Tower, was the winning design in an international competition to design a tower for the city centre of Glasgow.[16] The original architectural design was by the architect Richard Horden, with engineering design by Buro Happold, but after commissioning the project was taken over by the Glasgow architects BDP. In the end the tower cost \u00a310 million. Glasgow City Council successfully sued contractors Carillion over the quality of the work.[7]\naerofoil[16][16]Richard HordenBuro Happold\u00a3Carillion[7][7]Tallest building debate[edit]Tallest building debate[edit][edit] The tower as viewed from its base The tower as viewed from its baseThe tower as viewed from its baseWhen completed in 2001, it became the second tallest self supporting structure in Scotland, behind the Inverkip Power Station chimney. The website for the tower claims it is \"The tallest freestanding building in Scotland\".[17] Although the tower has an observation deck at 330 feet (100\u00a0m),[18] it does not have floors continuously from the ground and therefore the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) does not consider it to be a building.\nInverkip Power Station[17][17][18][18]Council on Tall Buildings and Urban HabitatSee also[edit]See also[edit][edit]Portsmouth's stylistically similar Spinnaker Tower, England's tallest building outside London.Portsmouth's stylistically similar Spinnaker Tower, England's tallest building outside London.PortsmouthSpinnaker TowerReferences[edit]References[edit][edit]\n^ Science Centre Tower at Emporis\n\n^ https://www.visitglasgow.net/things-to-do/tourist-attractions/glasgow-tower\n\n^ \"Glasgow Tower | Glasgow Science Centre\". www.glasgowsciencecentre.org.

By November 2011, building work for the roof of the arena had begun, which was completed by April 2013. The arena's signature translucent outer cushions were installed in May 2013, along with the seating inside of the arena, marking construction of the arena completed, taking two years to complete.[5]\n\n2013 roof fire[edit]\nAt approximately 15:20 on Sunday 8 June 2013,[12] flames were reported to be coming from the domed roof of the partially completed building.[13]  40 firefighters from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service attended the blaze.[14] It was determined that the fire was caused by ongoing welding work on the building's roof.[15][16] On 18 June, the venue's operator revealed that despite additional challenges, work on the venue was still on track for completion.[17]\n\nEvents[edit]\n SEC Armadillo (left) and OVO Hydro lit green for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference\nEntertainment[edit]\nMain article: List of entertainment events at The OVO Hydro\nSports[edit]\nOn 14 December 2014, the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award ceremony was held at the venue.[18] During the 2014 Commonwealth Games the SSE Hydro was home to the netball and gymnastic events.[19] On 18 July 2015, the UFC held their inaugural Scottish event UFC Fight Night: Bisping vs. Leites at the Hydro.[20] From 23 October to 1 November 2015, the SSE Hydro hosted the Artistic gymnastics world championships.[21]\nIn 2016, the venue hosted a heavyweight boxing fight between Dillian Whyte and Ian Lewison. Later it has hosted four boxing fights headlined by Scottish light welterweight boxer Josh Taylor. It also hosted two rounds of the 2018\u201319 World Boxing Super Series.\n\nFilming location[edit]\nThe OVO Hydro was used for exterior shots of the venue for the fictional 2020 Eurovision Song Contest in the 2020 film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.[22]\n\nPolitics[edit]\nThe OVO Hydro was host to the largest televised debate seen in Scotland's history, Scotland Decides: The Big, Big Debate, held on the evening of Thursday 11 September 2014; towards the end of the Scottish independence referendum campaign. The Mentorn/BBC Scotland organised debate, in which every secondary school in Scotland was invited to take part, involved around 7,500 first time voters and was broadcast on BBC One during the evening of 11 September 2014[23] and was presented by James Cook.[24]\n\nTicket sales records[edit]\nIn 2016, the arena handled 751,487 ticket sales; making it the eighth-busiest music arena in the world in terms of ticket sales. It also hosted the UFC's first event in Scotland.[25]\nIn 2019, the Hydro was the second busiest venue in the world behind Madison Square Garden in New York City.[26] The venue attracts over 1 million visitors per year, making it a regular feature in the top ten arenas globally.[27]\n\n\n\nWorld's Busiest Arenas \u2013 2018[28]\n\n\nVenue\n\nTicket sales\n\n\nMadison Square Garden Arena, New York, USA\n\n1,155,480\n\n\nThe Forum, Inglewood, USA\n\n1,119,313\n\n\nWiZink Center, Madrid, Spain\n\n1,118,706\n\n\nThe OVO Hydro, Glasgow, UK\n\n1,040,956\n\n\nAccorHotels Arena, Paris, France\n\n938,771\n\n\nLittle Caesars Arena, Detroit, USA\n\n845,651\n\n\nManchester Arena, Manchester, UK\n\n822,155\n\n\nBarclays Center, Brooklyn, USA\n\n816,980\n\n\nWells Fargo Center, Philadelphia, U.S.\n\n807,370\n\n\nSydney Super Dome, Sydney, Australia\n\n790,798\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ OVO Hydro (14 October 2021). \"ABOUT OVO HYDRO\".

Designed by architects Foster and Partners, construction of the 3,000 seat venue  started in September 1995, and was completed in August 1997, by which time it had earned its affectionate nickname, due to the similarity of its shape to that of the animal of the same name.\nMany comparisons have been made with the Sydney Opera House, although this was not the architects' inspiration for the design, which was in fact an interlocking series of ship's hulls, in reference to the Clyde's shipbuilding heritage.\nThe building has become one of the most recognisable on Clydeside and an iconic image of Glasgow. It is connected by passageways to the SEC Centre, and the Crowne Plaza hotel for easy access and exit for performers.\n\nEvents[edit]\nThe building has held events, such as the Scottish auditions of Britain's Got Talent 2008 to 2010,[citation needed] the auditions for the first four editions of The X Factor[citation needed] and the Hugo Award ceremony during Interaction, the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention.[citation needed] Singer Susan Boyle was discovered at this venue.[citation needed]\nThe building served as the venue for the weightlifting competitions of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, held in Glasgow.[citation needed] In the season of Christmas, the Armadillo is used for pantomimes.[citation needed] Westlife lead vocalist Shane Filan played at the venue twice as a solo artist in 2016 and 2017.[citation needed]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"All change as SECC is renamed the Scottish Event Campus\".

It is connected by passageways to the SEC Centre, and the Crowne Plaza hotel for easy access and exit for performers.\nSEC CentreCrowne PlazaEvents[edit]Events[edit][edit]The building has held events, such as the Scottish auditions of Britain's Got Talent 2008 to 2010,[citation needed] the auditions for the first four editions of The X Factor[citation needed] and the Hugo Award ceremony during Interaction, the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention.[citation needed] Singer Susan Boyle was discovered at this venue.[citation needed]\nBritain's Got TalentBritain's Got Talent20082010[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededfirstfoureditionsofThe X FactorThe X Factor[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededHugo Award63rd World Science Fiction Convention[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededSusan Boyle[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededThe building served as the venue for the weightlifting competitions of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, held in Glasgow.[citation needed] In the season of Christmas, the Armadillo is used for pantomimes.[citation needed] Westlife lead vocalist Shane Filan played at the venue twice as a solo artist in 2016 and 2017.[citation needed]\nweightlifting2014 Commonwealth Games[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededpantomimes[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededWestlifeShane Filan[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededReferences[edit]References[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}\n\n^ \"All change as SECC is renamed the Scottish Event Campus\".
