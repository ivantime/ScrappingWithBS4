Top row: Automatic mechanical calculator (1820) (Difference Engine), First-generation computer (Colossus computer) middle row: Early vacuum tube computer (ENIAC), Supercomputer (IBM Summit)bottom row: Video game console (Nintendo GameCube), Smartphone (LYF Water 2)\nA computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a \"complete\" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for \"full\" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.\nA broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.\nEarly computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.\nConventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.\n\nContents\n\n1 Etymology\n2 History\n\n2.1 Pre-20th century\n2.2 First computer\n2.3 Analog computers\n2.4 Digital computers\n\n2.4.1 Electromechanical\n2.4.2 Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits\n\n\n2.5 Modern computers\n\n2.5.1 Concept of modern computer\n2.5.2 Stored programs\n2.5.3 Transistors\n2.5.4 Integrated circuits\n\n\n2.6 Mobile computers\n\n\n3 Types\n\n3.1 By architecture\n3.2 By size, form-factor and purpose\n\n\n4 Hardware\n\n4.1 History of computing hardware\n4.2 Other hardware topics\n4.3 Input devices\n4.4 Output devices\n4.5 Control unit\n4.6 Central processing unit (CPU)\n4.7 Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)\n4.8 Memory\n4.9 Input/output (I/O)\n4.10 Multitasking\n4.11 Multiprocessing\n\n\n5 Software\n\n5.1 Languages\n5.2 Programs\n\n5.2.1 Stored program architecture\n5.2.2 Machine code\n5.2.3 Programming language\n\n5.2.3.1 Low-level languages\n5.2.3.2 High-level languages\n\n\n5.2.4 Program design\n5.2.5 Bugs\n\n\n\n\n6 Networking and the Internet\n7 Unconventional computers\n8 Future\n\n8.1 Computer architecture paradigms\n8.2 Artificial intelligence\n\n\n9 Professions and organizations\n10 See also\n11 Notes\n12 References\n13 Sources\n14 External links\n\n\n\nEtymology\n A human computer, with microscope and calculator, 1952\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of computer was in a 1613 book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by the English writer Richard Brathwait: \"I haue  [sic] read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number.\" This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.[1] By 1943, most human computers were women.[2]\nThe Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the 1640s, meaning 'one who calculates'; this is an \"agent noun from compute (v.)\". The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the use of the term to mean \"'calculating machine' (of any type) is from 1897.\"  The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates that the \"modern use\" of the term, to mean 'programmable digital electronic computer' dates from \"1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as Turing machine\".[3]\n\nHistory\nMain articles: History of computing and History of computing hardware\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of computing.\nPre-20th century\n The Ishango bone, a bone tool dating back to prehistoric Africa.\nDevices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[a][4] The use of counting rods is one example.\n\n The Chinese suanpan (\u7b97\u76d8). The number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408.\nThe abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.[5]\n\n The Antikythera mechanism, dating back to ancient Greece circa 150\u2013100 BC, is an early analog computing device.\nThe Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, according to Derek J. de Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to approximately c.\u2009100 BC. Devices of comparable complexity to the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteenth century.[7]\nMany mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented by Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b in the early 11th century.[8] The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[9][10] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[11] Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe,[12] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[13] with a gear train and gear-wheels,[14] c.\u20091000 AD.\nThe sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.\nThe planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.\n\n A slide rule.\nThe slide rule was invented around 1620\u20131630 by the English clergyman William Oughtred, shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.\nIn the 1770s, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll (automaton) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically \"programmed\" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, and still operates.[15]\nIn 1831\u20131835, mathematician and engineer Giovanni Plana devised a Perpetual Calendar machine, which, through a system of pulleys and cylinders and over, could predict the perpetual calendar for every year from AD 0 (that is, 1 BC) to AD 4000, keeping track of leap years and varying day length. The tide-predicting machine invented by the Scottish scientist Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.\nThe differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876, Sir William Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[16] In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.\n\nFirst computer\n A portion of Babbage's Difference engine.\nCharles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the \"father of the computer\",[17] he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[18][19]\nThe machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand \u2013 this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.\n\nAnalog computers\nMain article: Analog computer\n Sir William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, 1879\u201381\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.[20] The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson (later to become Lord Kelvin) in 1872. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the elder brother of the more famous Sir William Thomson.[16]\nThe art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education (slide rule) and aircraft (control systems).\n\nDigital computers\nElectromechanical\nBy 1938, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well.\n\n Replica of Konrad Zuse's Z3, the first fully automatic, digital (electromechanical) computer.\nEarly digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.[21]\nIn 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3, the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer.[22][23] The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5\u201310 Hz.[24] Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard. It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating-point numbers. Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design), using a binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time.[25] The Z3 was not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be Turing complete.[26][27]\nZuse's next computer, the Z4, became the world's first commercial computer; after initial delay due to the Second World War, it was completed in 1950 and delivered to the ETH Zurich.[28] The computer was manufactured by Zuse's own company, Zuse KG\u00a0[de], which was founded in 1941 as the first company with the sole purpose of developing computers.[28]\n\nVacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits\n\nPurely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes.[20] In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942,[29] the first \"automatic electronic digital computer\".[30] This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory.[31]\n\n Colossus, the first electronic digital programmable computing device, was used to break German ciphers during World War II. It is seen here in use at Bletchley Park in 1943.\nDuring World War II, the British code-breakers at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes which were often run by women.[32][33] To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus.[31] He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.[34] After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944[35] and attacked its first message on 5 February.[31]\nColossus was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer.[20] It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1,500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2,400 valves, was both five times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I, greatly speeding the decoding process.[36][37]\n\n ENIAC was the first electronic, Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the United States Army.\nThe ENIAC[38] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer built in the U.S. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was Turing-complete. Like the Colossus, a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. The programmers of the ENIAC were six women, often known collectively as the \"ENIAC girls\".[39][40]\nIt combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.[41]\n\nModern computers\nConcept of modern computer\nThe principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper,[42] On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called \"Universal Computing machine\" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.[43] Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.\n\nStored programs\nMain article: Stored-program computer\n A section of the Manchester Baby, the first electronic stored-program computer\nEarly computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.[31] With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper. In 1945, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report \"Proposed Electronic Calculator\" was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the University of Pennsylvania also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in 1945.[20]\nThe Manchester Baby was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the University of Manchester in England by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.[44] It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device.[45] Although the computer was considered \"small and primitive\" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer.[46] As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark 1. Grace Hopper was the first person to develop a compiler for programming language.[2]\nThe Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.[47] Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February 1951. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.[48] In October 1947, the directors of British catering company J. Lyons & Company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in April 1951[49] and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job.\n\nTransistors\nMain articles: Transistor and History of the transistor\nFurther information: Transistor computer and MOSFET\n Bipolar junction transistor (BJT)\nThe concept of a field-effect transistor was proposed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs, built the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947, which was followed by Shockley's bipolar junction transistor in 1948.[50][51] From 1955 onwards, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the \"second generation\" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.[52]\nAt the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves.[53] Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125\u00a0kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955,[54] built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.[54][55]\n\n MOSFET (MOS transistor), showing gate (G), body (B), source (S) and drain (D) terminals. The gate is separated from the body by an insulating layer (pink).\nThe metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET), also known as the MOS transistor, was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.[56] It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses.[52] With its high scalability,[57] and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors,[58] the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits.[59][60] In addition to data processing, it also enabled the practical use of MOS transistors as memory cell storage elements, leading to the development of MOS semiconductor memory, which replaced earlier magnetic-core memory in computers. The MOSFET led to the microcomputer revolution,[61] and became the driving force behind the computer revolution.[62][63] The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers,[64][65] and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics.[66]\n\nIntegrated circuits\nMain articles: Integrated circuit and Invention of the integrated circuit\nFurther information: Planar process and Microprocessor\nThe next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit (IC).\nThe idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington,\u00a0D.C. on 7 May 1952.[67]\nThe first working ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.[68] Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.[69] In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as \"a body of semiconductor material\u00a0... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated\".[70][71] However, Kilby's invention was a hybrid integrated circuit (hybrid IC), rather than a monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip.[72] Kilby's IC had external wire connections, which made it difficult to mass-produce.[73]\nNoyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.[74] Noyce's invention was the first true monolithic IC chip.[75][73] His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium. Noyce's monolithic IC was fabricated using the planar process, developed by his colleague Jean Hoerni in early 1959. In turn, the planar process was based on Mohamed M. Atalla's work on semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide in the late 1950s.[76][77][78]\nModern monolithic ICs are predominantly MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) integrated circuits, built from MOSFETs (MOS transistors).[79] The earliest experimental MOS IC to be fabricated was a 16-transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962.[80] General Microelectronics later introduced the first commercial MOS IC in 1964,[81] developed by Robert Norman.[80] Following the development of the self-aligned gate (silicon-gate) MOS transistor by Robert Kerwin, Donald Klein and John Sarace at Bell Labs in 1967, the first silicon-gate MOS IC with self-aligned gates was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968.[82] The MOSFET has since become the most critical device component in modern ICs.[83]\nThe development of the MOS integrated circuit led to the invention of the microprocessor,[84][85] and heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term \"microprocessor\", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,[86] designed and realized by Federico Faggin with his silicon-gate MOS IC technology,[84] along with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel.[b][88] In the early 1970s, MOS IC technology enabled the integration of more than 10,000 transistors on a single chip.[60]\nSystem on a Chip (SoCs) are complete computers on a microchip (or chip) the size of a coin.[89] They may or may not have integrated RAM and flash memory. If not integrated, the RAM is usually placed directly above (known as Package on package) or below (on the opposite side of the circuit board) the SoC, and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the SoC, this all done to improve data transfer speeds, as the data signals don't have to travel long distances. Since ENIAC in 1945, computers have advanced enormously, with modern SoCs (Such as the Snapdragon 865) being the size of a coin while also being hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than ENIAC, integrating billions of transistors, and consuming only a few watts of power.\n\nMobile computers\nThe first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power. The 50\u00a0lb (23\u00a0kg) IBM 5100 was an early example. Later portables such as the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in. The first laptops, such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating batteries \u2013 and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.[90] The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by the early 2000s.\nThese smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing device on the market.[91] These are powered by System on a Chip (SoCs), which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin.[89]\n\nTypes\nSee also: Classes of computers\nComputers can be classified in a number of different ways, including:\n\nBy architecture\nAnalog computer\nDigital computer\nHybrid computer\nHarvard architecture\nVon Neumann architecture\nComplex instruction set computer\nReduced instruction set computer\nBy size, form-factor and purpose\nSupercomputer\nMainframe computer\nMinicomputer (term no longer used)\nServer\nRackmount server\nBlade server\nTower server\nPersonal computer\nWorkstation\nMicrocomputer (term no longer used)\nHome computer\nDesktop computer\nTower desktop\nSlimline desktop\nMultimedia computer (non-linear editing system computers, video editing PCs and the like)\nGaming computer\nAll-in-one PC\nNettop (Small form factor PCs, Mini PCs)\nHome theater PC\nKeyboard computer\nPortable computer\nThin client\nInternet appliance\nLaptop\nDesktop replacement computer\nGaming laptop\nRugged laptop\n2-in-1 PC\nUltrabook\nChromebook\nSubnotebook\nNetbook\nMobile computers:\nTablet computer\nSmartphone\nUltra-mobile PC\nPocket PC\nPalmtop PC\nHandheld PC\nWearable computer\nSmartwatch\nSmartglasses\nSingle-board computer\nPlug computer\nStick PC\nProgrammable logic controller\nComputer-on-module\nSystem on module\nSystem in a package\nSystem-on-chip (Also known as an Application Processor or AP if it lacks circuitry such as radio circuitry)\nMicrocontroller\nHardware\nMain articles: Computer hardware, Personal computer hardware, Central processing unit, and Microprocessor Video demonstrating the standard components of a \"slimline\" computer\nThe term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects.

These parts are interconnected by buses, often made of groups of wires. Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents a bit (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a \"1\", and when off it represents a \"0\" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.\n\nInput devices\nWhen unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices. The input devices may be hand-operated or automated. The act of processing is mainly regulated by the CPU. Some examples of input devices are:\n\nComputer keyboard\nDigital camera\nDigital video\nGraphics tablet\nImage scanner\nJoystick\nMicrophone\nMouse\nOverlay keyboard\nReal-time clock\nTrackball\nTouchscreen\nLight pen\nOutput devices\nThe means through which computer gives output are known as output devices. Some examples of output devices are:\n\nComputer monitor\nPrinter\nPC speaker\nProjector\nSound card\nVideo card\nControl unit\nMain articles: CPU design and Control unit\n Diagram showing how a particular MIPS architecture instruction would be decoded by the control system\nThe control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer.[d] Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.\nA key component common to all CPUs is the program counter, a special memory cell (a register) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.[e]\nThe control system's function is as follows\u2014 this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:\n\nRead the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.\nDecode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.\nIncrement the program counter so it points to the next instruction.\nRead whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.\nProvide the necessary data to an ALU or register.\nIf the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.\nWrite the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.\nJump back to step (1).\nSince the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as \"jumps\" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow).\nThe sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen.\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU)\nMain articles: Central processing unit and Microprocessor\nThe control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components. Since the 1970s, CPUs have typically been constructed on a single MOS integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor.\n\nArithmetic logic unit (ALU)\nMain article: Arithmetic logic unit\nThe ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.[92] The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and square roots. Some can operate only on whole numbers (integers) while others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation\u2014although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (\"is 64 greater than 65?\"). Logic operations involve Boolean logic: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing Boolean logic.\nSuperscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.[93] Graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices.\n\nMemory\nMain articles: Computer memory and Computer data storage\n Magnetic-core memory (using magnetic cores) was the computer memory of choice in the 1960s, until it was replaced by semiconductor memory (using MOS memory cells).\nA computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered \"address\" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to \"put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357\" or to \"add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.\" The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.\nIn almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits (called a byte). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (28 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or \u2212128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in two's complement notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.\nThe CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.\nComputer main memory comes in two principal varieties:\n\nrandom-access memory or RAM\nread-only memory or ROM\nRAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.[f]\nIn more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM cache memories, which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.\n\nInput/output (I/O)\nMain article: Input/output\n Hard disk drives are common storage devices used with computers.\nI/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world.[95] Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals.[96] On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices such as the display and printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices. Computer networking is another form of I/O.\nI/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.[citation needed] Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O. A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.\n\nMultitasking\nMain article: Computer multitasking\nWhile a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.[97] One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running \"at the same time\". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed \"time-sharing\" since each program is allocated a \"slice\" of time in turn.[98]\nBefore the era of inexpensive computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer. Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a \"time slice\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.\n\nMultiprocessing\nMain article: Multiprocessing\n Cray designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.\nSome computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed in only large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.\nSupercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general-purpose computers.[g] They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful for only specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography applications, as well as with other so-called \"embarrassingly parallel\" tasks.\n\nSoftware\nMain article: Software\nSoftware refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form, such as programs, data, protocols, etc. Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. It is often divided into system software and application software Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own. When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible computer, it is sometimes called \"firmware\".\n\n\n\nOperating system /System Software\n\nUnix and BSD\nUNIX System V, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Solaris (SunOS), IRIX, List of BSD operating systems\n\n\nLinux\nList of Linux distributions, Comparison of Linux distributions\n\n\nMicrosoft Windows\nWindows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11\n\n\nDOS\n86-DOS (QDOS), IBM PC DOS, MS-DOS, DR-DOS, FreeDOS\n\n\nMacintosh operating systems\nClassic Mac OS, macOS (previously OS X and Mac OS X)\n\n\nEmbedded and real-time\nList of embedded operating systems\n\n\nExperimental\nAmoeba, Oberon\u2013AOS, Bluebottle, A2, Plan 9 from Bell Labs\n\n\nLibrary\nMultimedia\nDirectX, OpenGL, OpenAL, Vulkan (API)\n\n\nProgramming library\nC standard library, Standard Template Library\n\n\nData\nProtocol\nTCP/IP, Kermit, FTP, HTTP, SMTP\n\n\nFile format\nHTML, XML, JPEG, MPEG, PNG\n\n\nUser interface\nGraphical user interface (WIMP)\nMicrosoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, QNX Photon, CDE, GEM, Aqua\n\n\nText-based user interface\nCommand-line interface, Text user interface\n\n\nApplication Software\n\nOffice suite\nWord processing, Desktop publishing, Presentation program, Database management system, Scheduling & Time management, Spreadsheet, Accounting software\n\n\nInternet Access\nBrowser, Email client, Web server, Mail transfer agent, Instant messaging\n\n\nDesign and manufacturing\nComputer-aided design, Computer-aided manufacturing, Plant management, Robotic manufacturing, Supply chain management\n\n\nGraphics\nRaster graphics editor, Vector graphics editor, 3D modeler, Animation editor, 3D computer graphics, Video editing, Image processing\n\n\nAudio\nDigital audio editor, Audio playback, Mixing, Audio synthesis, Computer music\n\n\nSoftware engineering\nCompiler, Assembler, Interpreter, Debugger, Text editor, Integrated development environment, Software performance analysis, Revision control, Software configuration management\n\n\nEducational\nEdutainment, Educational game, Serious game, Flight simulator\n\n\nGames\nStrategy, Arcade, Puzzle, Simulation, First-person shooter, Platform, Massively multiplayer, Interactive fiction\n\n\nMisc\nArtificial intelligence, Antivirus software, Malware scanner, Installer/Package management systems, File manager\n\nLanguages\nThere are thousands of different programming languages\u2014some intended for general purpose, others useful for only highly specialized applications.\n\n\nProgramming languages\n\n\nLists of programming languages\nTimeline of programming languages, List of programming languages by category, Generational list of programming languages, List of programming languages, Non-English-based programming languages\n\n\nCommonly used assembly languages\nARM, MIPS, x86\n\n\nCommonly used high-level programming languages\nAda, BASIC, C, C++, C#, COBOL, Fortran, PL/I, REXX, Java, Lisp, Pascal, Object Pascal\n\n\nCommonly used scripting languages\nBourne script, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl\n\nPrograms\nThe defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be programmed. That is to say that some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language. In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.\n\nStored program architecture\nMain articles: Computer program and Computer programming\n Replica of the Manchester Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program computer, at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, England\nThis section applies to most common RAM machine\u2013based computers.\nIn most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's memory and are generally carried out (executed) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called \"jump\" instructions (or branches). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that \"remembers\" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.\nProgram execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.\nComparatively, a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example is written in the MIPS assembly language:\n\n\n  begin:\n  addi $8, $0, 0           # initialize sum to 0\n  addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1\n  loop:\n  slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000\n  beq $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit\n  add $8, $8, $9           # update sum\n  addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number\n  j loop                   # repeat the summing process\n  finish:\n  add $2, $8, $0           # put sum in output register\n\nOnce told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.\n\nMachine code\nIn most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture.[100][101] In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.\nWhile it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while this technique was used with many early computers,[h] it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember\u00a0\u2013 a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.\n\n A 1970s punched card containing one line from a Fortran program. The card reads: \"Z(1) = Y + W(1)\" and is labeled \"PROJ039\" for identification purposes.\nProgramming language\nMain article: Programming language\nProgramming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by an interpreter. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.\n\nLow-level languages\nMain article: Low-level programming language\nMachine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed low-level programming languages) are generally unique to the particular architecture of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). For instance, an ARM architecture CPU (such as may be found in a smartphone or a hand-held videogame) cannot understand the machine language of an x86 CPU that might be in a PC.[i] Historically a significant number of other cpu architectures were created and saw extensive use, notably including the MOS Technology 6502 and 6510 in addition to the Zilog Z80.\n\nHigh-level languages\nMain article: High-level programming language\nAlthough considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually \"compiled\" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler.[j] High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles.\n\nProgram design\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nProgram design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.\nThe task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge.\n\nBugs\nMain article: Software bug\n The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer\nErrors in computer programs are called \"bugs\". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to \"hang\", becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash.[102] Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit, code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.[k] Admiral Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited for having first used the term \"bugs\" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947.[103]\n\nNetworking and the Internet\nMain articles: Computer networking and Internet\n Visualization of a portion of the routes on the Internet\nComputers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's SAGE system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as Sabre.[104] In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET.[105] The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.\nIn time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. \"Wireless\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.\n\n\nUnconventional computers\nMain article: Human computer\nSee also: Harvard Computers\nA computer does not need to be electronic, nor even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even a hard disk. While popular usage of the word \"computer\" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer,[l] the modern definition of a computer is literally: \"A device that computes, especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information.\"[106] Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.[citation needed]\n\nFuture\nThere is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as optical computers, DNA computers, neural computers, and quantum computers. Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function, and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by quantum factoring) very quickly.\n\nComputer architecture paradigms\nThere are many types of computer architectures:\n\nQuantum computer vs. Chemical computer\nScalar processor vs. Vector processor\nNon-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) computers\nRegister machine vs. Stack machine\nHarvard architecture vs. von Neumann architecture\nCellular architecture\nOf all these abstract machines, a quantum computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing.[107] Logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms. The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators. The Church\u2013Turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a minimum capability (being Turing-complete) is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer (netbook, supercomputer, cellular automaton, etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.\n\nArtificial intelligence\nA computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories: rule-based systems and pattern recognition systems. Rule-based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop. Pattern-based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions. Examples of pattern-based systems include voice recognition, font recognition, translation and the emerging field of on-line marketing.\n\nProfessions and organizations\nAs the use of computers has spread throughout society, there are an increasing number of careers involving computers.\n\n\nComputer-related professions\n\n\nHardware-related\nElectrical engineering, Electronic engineering, Computer engineering, Telecommunications engineering, Optical engineering, Nanoengineering\n\n\nSoftware-related\nComputer science, Computer engineering, Desktop publishing, Human\u2013computer interaction, Information technology, Information systems, Computational science, Software engineering, Video game industry, Web design\n\nThe need for computers to work well together and to be able to exchange information has spawned the need for many standards organizations, clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature.\n\n\nOrganizations\n\n\nStandards groups\nANSI, IEC, IEEE, IETF, ISO, W3C\n\n\nProfessional societies\nACM, AIS, IET, IFIP, BCS\n\n\nFree/open source software groups\nFree Software Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Apache Software Foundation\n\nSee also\n\nGlossary of computers\nComputability theory\nComputer security\nGlossary of computer hardware terms\nHistory of computer science\nList of computer term etymologies\nList of fictional computers\nList of pioneers in computer science\nPulse computation\nTOP500 (list of most powerful computers)\nUnconventional computing\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ According to Schmandt-Besserat 1981, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a bill of lading or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers.Eventually the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count. Schmandt-Besserat 1999 estimates it took 4000 years.\n\n^ The Intel 4004 (1971) die was 12\u00a0mm2, composed of 2300 transistors; by comparison, the Pentium Pro was 306\u00a0mm2, composed of 5.5\u00a0million transistors.[87]\n\n^ Most major 64-bit instruction set architectures are extensions of earlier designs. All of the architectures listed in this table, except for Alpha, existed in 32-bit forms before their 64-bit incarnations were introduced.\n\n^ The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Some computers have instructions that are partially interpreted by the control unit with further interpretation performed by another device. For example, EDVAC, one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that interpreted only four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.\n\n^ Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.\n\n^ Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage.[94] \n\n^ However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called computer clusters can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years.[99] \n\n^ Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some minicomputers like the DEC PDP-8 could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the booting process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some non-volatile memory.\n\n^ However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An x86-64 compatible microprocessor like the AMD Athlon 64 is able to run most of the same programs that an Intel Core 2 microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel Pentiums and Intel 80486. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.\n\n^ High level languages are also often interpreted rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called an interpreter.\n\n^ It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the Pentium FDIV bug caused some Intel microprocessors in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain floating point division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.\n\n^ According to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6th ed, 2007), the word computer dates back to the mid 17th century, when it referred to \"A person who makes calculations; specifically a person employed for this in an observatory etc.\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Evans 2018, p.\u00a023.\n\n^ a b Smith 2013, p.\u00a06.\n\n^ \"computer (n.)\".

Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a \"complete\" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for \"full\" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.\ncomputerdigital electronicmachinecarry outsequencesarithmeticlogical operationscomputationprogramscomputer systemhardwareoperating systemsoftwareperipheralcomputer networkcomputer clusterA broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.\nindustrialconsumer productscontrol systemsmicrowave ovensremote controlsindustrial robotscomputer-aided designpersonal computersmobile devicessmartphonesInternetEarly computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.\nabacusIndustrial RevolutionloomsmachinesanalogdigitalWorld War IIsemiconductortransistorssiliconMOSFETmonolithic integrated circuitmicroprocessormicrocomputer revolutiontransistor countsMoore's lawDigital RevolutionConventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.\nprocessing elementcentral processing

writer Richard Brathwait: \"I haue  [sic] read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number.\" This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.[1] By 1943, most human computers were women.[2]\nOxford English DictionaryOxford English DictionarycomputerThe Yong Mans GleaningsRichard Brathwaitsicsichuman computer[1][1][2][2]The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the 1640s, meaning 'one who calculates'; this is an \"agent noun from compute (v.)\".

A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[9][10] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[11] Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe,[12] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[13] with a gear train and gear-wheels,[14] c.\u20091000 AD.\nplanispherestar chartAb\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b[8][8]astrolabeHellenistic worldHipparchusdioptraspherical astronomycalendar[9][9][10][10]gearIsfahanPersia[11][11]lunisolar calendar[12][12]wiredmachine[13][13]gear train[14][14]c.\u20091000 ADThe sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.\nsectorThe planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.\nplanimeter A slide rule.

As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions.

By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically \"programmed\" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, and still operates.[15]\nPierre Jaquet-DrozwatchmakerautomatonNeuch\u00e2telSwitzerland[15][15]In 1831\u20131835, mathematician and engineer Giovanni Plana devised a Perpetual Calendar machine, which, through a system of pulleys and cylinders and over, could predict the perpetual calendar for every year from AD 0 (that is, 1 BC) to AD 4000, keeping track of leap years and varying day length. The tide-predicting machine invented by the Scottish scientist Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.\nGiovanni PlanaPerpetual Calendar machineperpetual calendartide-predicting machineSir William ThomsonThe differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876, Sir William Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[16] In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.\ndifferential analyserdifferential equationsintegrationball-and-disk integrators[16][16]torque amplifierVannevar BushFirst computerFirst computer A portion of Babbage's Difference engine. A portion of Babbage's Difference engine.A portion of Babbage's Difference engine.Babbage'sDifference engineCharles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the \"father of the computer\",[17] he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[18][19]\nCharles Babbagepolymathfather of the computer[17][17]mechanical computerdifference engineAnalytical Enginepunched cardsloomsJacquard loomarithmetic logic unitcontrol flowconditional branchingloopsmemoryTuring-complete[18][18][19][19]The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand \u2013 this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.\nBritish GovernmentHenry BabbagemillAnalog computersAnalog computersMain article: Analog computerAnalog computer Sir William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, 1879\u201381 Sir William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, 1879\u201381Sir William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, 1879\u201381Sir William ThomsonDuring the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.[20] The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson (later to become Lord Kelvin) in 1872. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the elder brother of the more famous Sir William Thomson.[16]\ncomputinganalog computerscomputation[20][20]tide-predicting machineSir William Thomsondifferential analyserJames Thomson[16][16]The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education (slide rule) and aircraft (control systems).\ndifferential analyzerVannevar BushMITJames Thomsondigital electronic computersslide rulecontrol systemsDigital computersDigital computersElectromechanicalElectromechanicalBy 1938, the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well.\nUnited States NavysubmarineTorpedo Data ComputerWorld War II Replica of Konrad Zuse's Z3, the first fully automatic, digital (electromechanical) computer.

These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.[21]\nelectromechanicalvacuum tubesZ2Konrad Zuse[21][21]In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3, the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer.[22][23] The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5\u201310 Hz.[24] Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard. It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating-point numbers. Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design), using a binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time.[25] The Z3 was not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be Turing complete.[26][27]\nZ3programmable[22][22][23][23]relaysbitword lengthclock frequencyHz[24][24]filmfloating-point numbersCharles Babbagebinary[25][25]Turing complete[26][26][27][27]Zuse's next computer, the Z4, became the world's first commercial computer; after initial delay due to the Second World War, it was completed in 1950 and delivered to the ETH Zurich.[28] The computer was manufactured by Zuse's own company, Zuse KG\u00a0[de], which was founded in 1941 as the first company with the sole purpose of developing computers.[28]\nZ4ETH Zurich[28][28]Zuse KG\u00a0[de]de[28][28]Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuitsVacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits\nPurely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes.[20] In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942,[29] the first \"automatic electronic digital computer\".[30] This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory.[31]\nelectronic circuitTommy FlowersPost Office Research StationLondontelephone exchangetelephone exchangevacuum tubes[20][20]John Vincent AtanasoffClifford E.

The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes which were often run by women.[32][33] To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus.[31] He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.[34] After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944[35] and attacked its first message on 5 February.[31]\nBletchley ParkEnigmabombes[32][32][33][33]Lorenz SZ 40/42Max NewmanColossus[31][31][34][34][35][35][31][31]Colossus was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer.[20] It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1,500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2,400 valves, was both five times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I, greatly speeding the decoding process.[36][37]\nelectronicdigitalprogrammable[20][20]boolean logicalTuring-complete[36][36][37][37] ENIAC was the first electronic, Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the United States Army.

Like the Colossus, a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. The programmers of the ENIAC were six women, often known collectively as the \"ENIAC girls\".[39][40]\nENIAC[38][38]Turing-completestored program[39][39][40][40]It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.[41]\nJohn MauchlyJ. Presper Eckert[41][41]Modern computersModern computersConcept of modern computerConcept of modern computerThe principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper,[42] On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called \"Universal Computing machine\" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.[43] Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.\nAlan Turing[42][42]On Computable Numbersuniversal Turing machinestored programVon Neumann[43][43]theory of computationTuring-completealgorithmStored programsStored programsMain article: Stored-program computerStored-program computer A section of the Manchester Baby, the first electronic stored-program computer A section of the Manchester Baby, the first electronic stored-program computerA section of the Manchester Baby, the first electronic stored-program computerManchester Babystored-program computerEarly computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.[31] With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper. In 1945, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report \"Proposed Electronic Calculator\" was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the University of Pennsylvania also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in 1945.[20]\n[31][31]instruction setprogramcomputationAlan TuringNational Physical LaboratoryUniversity of PennsylvaniaFirst Draft of a Report on the EDVACFirst Draft of a Report on the EDVAC[20][20]The Manchester Baby was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the University of Manchester in England by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.[44] It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device.[45] Although the computer was considered \"small and primitive\" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer.[46] As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark 1. Grace Hopper was the first person to develop a compiler for programming language.[2]\nManchester Babystored-program computerUniversity of ManchesterFrederic C.

At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.[48] In October 1947, the directors of British catering company J. Lyons & Company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in April 1951[49] and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job.\nFerranti Mark 1[47][47]FerrantiShellAmsterdam[48][48]J.

John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs, built the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947, which was followed by Shockley's bipolar junction transistor in 1948.[50][51] From 1955 onwards, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the \"second generation\" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.[52]\nfield-effect transistorJulius Edgar LilienfeldJohn BardeenWalter BrattainWilliam ShockleyBell Labstransistorpoint-contact transistorbipolar junction transistor[50][50][51][51]vacuum tubesJunction transistorsmass-production[52][52]At the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves.[53] Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125\u00a0kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer.

The MOSFET led to the microcomputer revolution,[61] and became the driving force behind the computer revolution.[62][63] The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers,[64][65] and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics.[66]\nmetal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistorMohamed M.

Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium. Noyce's monolithic IC was fabricated using the planar process, developed by his colleague Jean Hoerni in early 1959. In turn, the planar process was based on Mohamed M.

While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term \"microprocessor\", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,[86] designed and realized by Federico Faggin with his silicon-gate MOS IC technology,[84] along with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel.[b][88] In the early 1970s, MOS IC technology enabled the integration of more than 10,000 transistors on a single chip.[60]\nmicroprocessor[84][84][85][85]Intel 4004[86][86][84][84]Ted HoffMasatoshi ShimaStanley MazorIntel[b][b][88][88]integration[60][60]System on a Chip (SoCs) are complete computers on a microchip (or chip) the size of a coin.[89] They may or may not have integrated RAM and flash memory. If not integrated, the RAM is usually placed directly above (known as Package on package) or below (on the opposite side of the circuit board) the SoC, and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the SoC, this all done to improve data transfer speeds, as the data signals don't have to travel long distances. Since ENIAC in 1945, computers have advanced enormously, with modern SoCs (Such as the Snapdragon 865) being the size of a coin while also being hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than ENIAC, integrating billions of transistors, and consuming only a few watts of power.\nSystem on a Chipmicrochip[89][89]RAMflash memoryPackage on packagecircuit boardMobile computersMobile computersThe first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power. The 50\u00a0lb (23\u00a0kg) IBM 5100 was an early example. Later portables such as the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in. The first laptops, such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating batteries \u2013 and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.[90] The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by the early 2000s.\nmobile computersIBM 5100Osborne 1Compaq PortablelaptopsGrid Compass[90][90]These smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing device

main components: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control unit, the memory, and the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by buses, often made of groups of wires. Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents a bit (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a \"1\", and when off it represents a \"0\" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.\narithmetic logic unitcontrol unitmemoryinput and output devicesbuseswireselectrical circuitselectronic switchbitlogic gatesInput devicesInput devicesWhen unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices.

The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.\nProvide the necessary data to an ALU or register.\nIf the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.\nWrite the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.\nJump back to step (1).Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.Jump back to step (1).Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as \"jumps\" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow).\ncontrol flowThe sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen.\ncomputer programmicrosequencermicrocodeCentral processing unit (CPU)Central processing unit (CPU)Main articles: Central processing unit and MicroprocessorCentral processing unitMicroprocessorThe control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components. Since the 1970s, CPUs have typically been constructed on a single MOS integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor.\ncentral processing unitMOS integrated circuitmicroprocessormicroprocessorArithmetic logic unit (ALU)Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)Main article: Arithmetic logic unitArithmetic logic unitThe ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.[92] The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and square roots. Some can operate only on whole numbers (integers) while others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation\u2014although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (\"is 64 greater than 65?\"). Logic operations involve Boolean logic: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing Boolean logic.\n[92][92]trigonometrysquare rootsintegersfloating pointreal numbersBoolean truth valuesBoolean logicANDORXORNOTconditional statementsBoolean logicSuperscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.[93] Graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices.\nSuperscalar[93][93]Graphics processorsSIMDMIMDvectorsmatricesMemoryMemoryMain articles: Computer memory and Computer data storageComputer memoryComputer data storage Magnetic-core memory (using magnetic cores) was the computer memory of choice in the 1960s, until it was replaced by semiconductor memory (using MOS memory cells).

Each cell has a numbered \"address\" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to \"put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357\" or to \"add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.\" The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.\nIn almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits (called a byte). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (28 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or \u2212128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in two's complement notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.\nbinary numbersbyte8two's complementThe CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.\nregistersComputer main memory comes in two principal varieties:\nrandom-access memory or RAM\nread-only memory or ROMrandom-access memory or RAMrandom-access memoryread-only memory or ROMread-only memoryRAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.[f]\nBIOSoperating systemembedded computersfirmwareFlash memory[f][f]In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM cache memories, which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.\ncache memoriesInput/output (I/O)Input/output (I/O)Main article: Input/outputInput/output Hard disk drives are common storage devices used with computers. Hard disk drives are common storage devices used with computers.Hard disk drives are common storage devices used with computers.Hard disk drivesI/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world.[95] Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals.[96] On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices such as the display and printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices. Computer networking is another form of I/O.\nI/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.[citation needed] Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O. A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.\n[95][95]peripherals[96][96]mousedisplayprinterHard disk drivesfloppy diskoptical disc drivesComputer networkinggraphics processing unit3D graphics[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededdesktop computersMultitaskingMultitaskingMain article: Computer multitaskingComputer multitaskingWhile a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.[97] One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running \"at the same time\". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed \"time-sharing\" since each program is allocated a \"slice\" of time in turn.[98]\n[97][97]interrupt[98][98]Before the era of inexpensive computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer. Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a \"time slice\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.\neventMultiprocessingMultiprocessingMain article: MultiprocessingMultiprocessing Cray designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily. Cray designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.Cray designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.CraySome computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed in only large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.\nsupercomputersmainframe computersserversmulti-coreSupercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general-purpose computers.[g] They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful for only specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography applications, as well as with other so-called \"embarrassingly parallel\" tasks.\n[g][g]simulationgraphics renderingcryptographyembarrassingly parallelSoftwareSoftwareMain article: SoftwareSoftwareSoftware refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form, such as programs, data, protocols, etc. Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. It is often divided into system software and application software Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own. When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible computer, it is sometimes called \"firmware\".\nSoftwarehardwarecomputer

machines is that they can be programmed. That is to say that some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language. In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.\nprogrammedinstructionsprogramvon Neumann architectureimperative programming languageword processorsweb browsersgigaflopsprogrammersStored program architectureStored program architectureMain articles: Computer program and Computer programmingComputer programComputer programming Replica of the Manchester Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program computer, at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, England Replica of the Manchester Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program computer, at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, EnglandReplica of the Manchester Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program computer, at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, EnglandManchester Babystored-program computerMuseum of Science and IndustryThis section applies to most common RAM machine\u2013based computers.\nRAM machineIn most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's memory and are generally carried out (executed) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called \"jump\" instructions (or branches). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that \"remembers\" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.\nmemoryexecutedbranchesconditionallysubroutinesProgram execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.\nflow of controlComparatively, a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example is written in the MIPS assembly language:\ncalculatorMIPS assembly language  begin:\n  addi $8, $0, 0           # initialize sum to 0\n  addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1\n  loop:\n  slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000\n  beq $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit\n  add $8, $8, $9           # update sum\n  addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number\n  j loop                   # repeat the summing process\n  finish:\n  add $2, $8, $0           # put sum in output register\n  begin:\n  addi $8, $0, 0           # initialize sum to 0\n  addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1\n  loop:\n  slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000\n  beq $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit\n  add $8, $8, $9           # update sum\n  addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number\n  j loop                   # repeat the summing process\n  finish:\n  add $2, $8, $0           # put sum in output register\nbegin:addi$8,$0,0# initialize sum to 0addi$9,$0,1# set first number to add = 1loop:slti$10,$9,1000# check if the number is less than 1000beq$10,$0,finish# if odd number is greater than n then exitadd$8,$8,$9# update sumaddi$9,$9,1# get next numberjloop# repeat the summing processfinish:add$2,$8,$0# put sum in output registerOnce told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.\nMachine codeMachine codeIn most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture.[100][101] In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.\nmachine codeopcode[100][100][101][101]Harvard architectureHarvard Mark ICPU cachesWhile it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while this technique was used with many early computers,[h] it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember\u00a0\u2013 a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.\nmachine language[h][h]mnemonicassembly language A 1970s punched card containing one line from a Fortran program.

Unlike natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by an interpreter. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.\nnatural languagesmachine codecompilerassemblerinterpreterLow-level languagesLow-level languagesMain article: Low-level programming languageLow-level programming languageMachine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed low-level programming languages) are generally unique to the particular architecture of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). For instance, an ARM architecture CPU (such as may be found in a smartphone or a hand-held videogame) cannot understand the machine language of an x86 CPU that might be in a PC.[i] Historically a significant number of other cpu architectures were created and saw extensive use, notably including the MOS Technology 6502 and 6510 in addition to the Zilog Z80.\nlow-level programming languagesCPUARM architecturesmartphonehand-held videogamex86PC[i][i]High-level languagesHigh-level languagesMain article: High-level programming languageHigh-level programming languageAlthough considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually \"compiled\" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler.[j] High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer.

As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.\nThe task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge.\nsoftwaresoftware engineeringBugsBugsMain article: Software bugSoftware bug The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computerThe actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computerHarvard Mark IIErrors in computer programs are called \"bugs\". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to \"hang\", becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash.[102] Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit, code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.[k] Admiral Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited for having first used the term \"bugs\" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947.[103]\nbugshangmousecrash[102][102]exploit[k][k]Grace HoppercompilerHarvard Mark II[103][103]Networking and the InternetNetworking and the InternetMain articles: Computer networking and InternetComputer networkingInternet Visualization of a portion of the routes on the Internet Visualization of a portion of the routes on the InternetVisualization of a portion of the routes on the InternetroutesComputers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's SAGE system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as Sabre.[104] In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET.[105] The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.\nSAGESabre[104][104]DARPAcomputer networkARPANET[105][105]In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. \"Wireless\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.\nWorld Wide WebEthernetADSLUnconventional computersUnconventional computersMain article: Human computerHuman computerSee also: Harvard ComputersHarvard ComputersA computer does not need to be electronic, nor even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even a hard disk. While popular usage of the word \"computer\" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer,[l] the modern definition of a computer is literally: \"A device that computes, especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information.\"[106] Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.[citation needed]\nelectronicprocessorRAMhard disk[l][l]A device that computes[106][106]processes information[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededFutureFutureThere is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as optical computers, DNA computers, neural computers, and quantum computers. Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function, and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by quantum factoring) very quickly.\noptical computersDNA computersneural computersquantum computerscomputable functionquantum factoringComputer architecture paradigmsComputer architecture paradigmsThere are many types of computer architectures:\ncomputer architecturesQuantum computer vs. Chemical computer\nScalar processor vs. Vector processor\nNon-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) computers\nRegister machine vs. Stack machine\nHarvard architecture vs. von Neumann architecture\nCellular architectureQuantum computer vs. Chemical computerQuantum computerChemical computerScalar processor vs. Vector processorScalar processorVector processorNon-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) computersNon-Uniform Memory AccessRegister machine vs. Stack machineRegister machineStack machineHarvard architecture vs. von Neumann architectureHarvard architecturevon Neumann architectureCellular architectureCellular architectureOf all these abstract machines, a quantum computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing.[107] Logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms. The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators. The Church\u2013Turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a minimum capability (being Turing-complete) is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer (netbook, supercomputer, cellular automaton, etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.\nabstract machines[107][107]Logic gatesdigitalanalogprogramscalculatorsChurch\u2013Turing thesisminimum capability (being Turing-complete)netbooksupercomputercellular automatonArtificial intelligenceArtificial intelligenceA computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories: rule-based systems and pattern recognition systems. Rule-based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop. Pattern-based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions. Examples of pattern-based systems include voice recognition, font recognition, translation and the emerging field of on-line marketing.\nartificial intelligencemachine learningrule-based

the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a bill of lading or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers.Eventually the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.

Some minicomputers like the DEC PDP-8 could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the booting process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some non-volatile memory.\n^^^Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code.

An x86-64 compatible microprocessor like the AMD Athlon 64 is able to run most of the same programs that an Intel Core 2 microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel Pentiums and Intel 80486. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.\n^^^However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers.

Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the Pentium FDIV bug caused some Intel microprocessors in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain floating point division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.\n^^^It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight.

Straddling the border between historic Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, the city now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and is governed by Glasgow City Council. It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands.\nGlasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the \"Second City of the British Empire\" for much of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.[8][9][10][11]\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938.[12] The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. Over 985,200 people live in the Greater Glasgow contiguous urban area, while the wider Glasgow City Region is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population.[3] The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2. Natives or inhabitants are known as Glaswegians, and are well known for their distinctive dialect and accent.\nGlasgow has the largest economy in Scotland and the third-highest GDP per capita of any city in the UK.[13][14] Glasgow's major cultural institutions \u2013 the Burrell Collection, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Ballet and Scottish Opera \u2013 enjoy international reputations. The city was the European Capital of Culture in 1990 and is notable for its architecture, culture, media, music scene, sports clubs and transport connections. It is the fifth-most visited city in the United Kingdom.[15] The city hosted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at its main events venue, the SEC Centre. Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the first European Championships in 2018, and was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020. The city is also well known in the sporting world for football, particularly the Old Firm rivalry between Celtic and Rangers.\n\nContents\n\n1 Etymology\n2 History\n\n2.1 Origins and development\n2.2 Trading port\n2.3 Industrialisation\n2.4 Sanitation\n2.5 Heraldry\n\n\n3 Government and politics\n\n3.1 Local government\n3.2 Central government\n\n3.2.1 Scottish Parliament\n3.2.2 UK Westminster Parliament\n3.2.3 Referendums\n\n\n3.3 Voter turnout\n\n\n4 Geography\n\n4.1 Location\n4.2 Climate\n\n\n5 Demographics\n6 Areas and suburbs\n\n6.1 City centre\n\n6.1.1 Retail and theatre district\n6.1.2 Merchant City\n6.1.3 International Financial Services District\n\n\n6.2 West End\n6.3 East End\n6.4 South Side\n6.5 North Glasgow\n\n\n7 Culture\n\n7.1 Recreation\n7.2 Music scene\n7.3 Media\n7.4 Religion\n7.5 Language\n7.6 Architecture\n\n\n8 Economy\n9 Transport\n\n9.1 Public transport\n9.2 Shipping\n9.3 Roads\n9.4 Airports\n\n\n10 Housing\n11 Healthcare\n12 Education\n13 Sport\n\n13.1 Football\n13.2 Rugby union\n13.3 Rugby league\n13.4 Ice hockey\n13.5 Swimming\n13.6 Basketball\n13.7 Other sports\n13.8 2014 Commonwealth Games\n\n\n14 Major incidents and tragedies\n15 Namesake area on Mars\n16 Twin towns and sister cities\n\n16.1 Partnerships\n\n\n17 Notable people\n18 Notes\n19 References\n\n19.1 Citations\n19.2 Bibliography\n\n\n20 External links\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe name Glasgow is Brittonic in origin. The first element glas, meaning \"grey-green, grey-blue\" both in Brittonic and modern day Welsh and the second *c\u00f6\u00fc, \"hollow\" (c.f. Welsh glas-cau),[16] giving a meaning of \"green-hollow\".[17]  The green-hollow may refer to the ravine to the east of Glasgow Cathedral. It is often said that the name means \"dear green place\" or that \"dear green place\" is a translation from Gaelic Glas Caomh.[18]  \"The dear green place\" remains an affectionate way of referring to the city. The modern Gaelic is Glaschu and derived from the same roots as the English.\nThe settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name, Cathures; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as Glasgu. It is also recorded that the King of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the Molendinar Burn where Glasgow Cathedral now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as Glasgu.\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of Glasgow\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Glasgow history.\nOrigins and development[edit]\nThe area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the River Clyde providing a natural location for fishing. The Romans later built outposts in the area and, to protect Roman Britannia from the Brittonic speaking (Celtic) Caledonians, constructed the Antonine Wall. Items from the wall, such as altars from Roman forts like Balmuildy, can be found at the Hunterian Museum today.\nGlasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian missionary Saint Mungo in the 6th century. He established a church on the Molendinar Burn, where the present Glasgow Cathedral stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.\nGlasgow grew over the following centuries. The Glasgow Fair reportedly began in 1190.[19] The first bridge over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285, giving its name to the Briggait area of the city, forming the main north\u2013south route over the river via Glasgow Cross. The founding of the University of Glasgow in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to become the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.[20]\nFollowing the European Protestant Reformation and with the encouragement of the Convention of Royal Burghs, the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year.[20] Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of Royal Burgh in 1611.[21] Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the Atlantic triangular slave trade.[22][23]\nDaniel Defoe visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, that Glasgow was \"the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted\". At that time the city's population was about 12,000, and the city was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to its economy and urban fabric, brought about by the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.\n\nTrading port[edit]\nAfter the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. Starting in 1668, the city's Tobacco Lords created a deep water port at Port Glasgow about 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) down the River Clyde, as the river from the city to that point was then too shallow for seagoing merchant ships.[24] By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on the River Clyde, with over 47,000,000\u00a0lb (21,000\u00a0t) of tobacco being imported each year at its peak.[25] At the time, Glasgow held a commercial importance as the city participated in the trade of sugar, tobacco and later cotton.[26]\n\nIndustrialisation[edit]\n Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881\nThe opening of the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire. After extensive river engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow. The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, John Knox, James Kay, Sir Muirhead Bone, Robert Eadie and L.S. Lowry, willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world, as did Stanley Spencer downriver at Port Glasgow.\n\n The 1919 Battle of George Square\nGlasgow's population had surpassed that of Edinburgh by 1821. The development of civic institutions included the City of Glasgow Police in 1800, one of the first municipal police forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the City of Glasgow Bank's collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the \"Second City of the Empire\" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping[27] and a quarter of all locomotives in the world.[28] In addition to its pre-eminence in shipbuilding, engineering, industrial machinery, bridge building, chemicals, explosives, coal and oil industries it developed as a major centre in textiles, garment-making, carpet manufacturing, leather processing, furniture-making, pottery, food, drink and cigarette making; printing and publishing. Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.[20]\nGlasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the Lowlands and the Highlands of Scotland, from Ireland and other parts of Britain and from Continental Europe.[20] During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the Milngavie water treatment works, Glasgow Subway, Glasgow Corporation Tramways, City Chambers, Mitchell Library and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of International Exhibitions at Kelvingrove Park, in 1888, 1901 and 1911, with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the Empire Exhibition, being subsequently held in 1938 at Bellahouston Park, which drew 13 million visitors.[29]\nThe 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After World War I, the city suffered from the impact of the Post\u2013World War I recession and from the later Great Depression, this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the \"Red Clydeside\" movement. The city had recovered by the outbreak of World War II. The city saw aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe[30] during the Clydebank Blitz, during the war, then grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950s. By the 1960s, growth of industry in countries like Japan and West Germany, weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries. As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, urban decay, population decline, welfare dependency and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial Bruce Report, which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city. The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts that started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s. This involved the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.[31]\n\n Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943)\nThe city invested heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and East Kilbride, dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands to halve the city's population base.[31] By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The \"Glasgow's miles better\" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment.[32] The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, its status as European Capital of Culture in 1990,[33] and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy.[34] However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler.[35] Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas, including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration, has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of gentrification.[36] In 2008, the city was listed by Lonely Planet as one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.[37]\nDespite Glasgow's economic renaissance, the East End of the city remains the focus of social deprivation.[38] A Glasgow Economic Audit report published in 2007 stated that the gap between prosperous and deprived areas of the city is widening.[39] In 2006, 47% of Glasgow's population lived in the most deprived 15% of areas in Scotland,[39] while the Centre for Social Justice reported 29.4% of the city's working-age residents to be \"economically inactive\".[38] Although marginally behind the UK average, Glasgow still has a higher employment rate than Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.[39] In 2008 the city was ranked at 43 for Personal Safety in the Mercer index of top 50 safest cities in the world.[40] The Mercer report was specifically looking at Quality of Living, yet by 2011 within Glasgow, certain areas were (still) \"failing to meet the Scottish Air Quality Objective levels for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10)\".[41]\n\nSanitation[edit]\nWith the population growing, the first scheme to provide a public water supply was by the Glasgow Company in 1806. A second company was formed in 1812, and the two merged in 1838, but there was some dissatisfaction with the quality of the water supplied.[42] The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company began supplying water to residents living to the south of the River Clyde in 1846, obtained from reservoirs, which gave 75,000 people a constant water supply,[42] but others were not so fortunate, and some 4,000 died in an outbreak of cholera in 1848/1849.[43] This led to the development of the Glasgow Corporation Water Works, with a project to raise the level of Loch Katrine and to convey clean water by gravity along a 26\u00a0mi (42\u00a0km) aqueduct to a holding reservoir at Milngavie, and then by pipes into the city.[44] The project cost \u00a3980,000[43] and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859.[45]\nThe engineer for the project was John Frederick Bateman, while James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project, and subsequently became Engineer in Chief for Glasgow Water Commissioners. He oversaw several improvements during his tenure, including a second aqueduct and further raising of water levels in Loch Katrine.[46] Additional supplies were provided by Loch Arklet in 1902, by impounding the water and creating a tunnel to allow water to flow into Loch Katrine. A similar scheme to create a reservoir in Glen Finglas was authorised in 1903, but was deferred, and was not completed until 1965.[43] Following the 2002 Glasgow floods, the waterborne parasite cryptosporidium was found in the reservoir at Milngavie, and so the new Milngavie water treatment works was built. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth in 2007, and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for \u00a310 million below its budgeted cost.[47]\nGood health requires both clean water and effective removal of sewage. The Caledonian Railway rebuilt many of the sewers, as part of a deal to allow them to tunnel under the city, and sewage treatment works were opened at Dalmarnoch in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. The works experimented to find better ways to treat sewage, and a number of experimental filters were constructed, until a full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 at a cost of \u00a34 million.[48] Treated sludge was dumped at sea, and Glasgow Corporation owned six sludge ships between 1904 and 1998,[49] when the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive ended the practice.[50] The sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel 3.1\u00a0mi (5.0\u00a0km) long, which provides 20\u00d710^6\u00a0imp\u00a0gal (90\u00a0Ml) of storm water storage. It will reduce the risk of flooding and the likelihood that sewage will overflow into the Clyde during storms.[51] Since 2002, clean water provision and sewerage have been the responsibility of Scottish Water.[52]\n\nHeraldry[edit]\nThe coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866CrestSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.\nThe coat of arms of the City of Glasgow was granted to the royal burgh by the Lord Lyon on 25 October 1866.[53] It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date. The emblems represent miracles supposed to have been performed by Mungo[54] and are listed in the traditional rhyme:\n\nHere's the bird that never flew\nHere's the tree that never grew\nHere's the bell that never rang\nHere's the fish that never swam\nSt Mungo is also said to have preached a sermon containing the words Lord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name. This was abbreviated to \"Let Glasgow Flourish\" and adopted as the city's motto.\nIn 1450, John Stewart, the first Lord Provost of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a \"St Mungo's Bell\" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the People's Palace Museum, near Glasgow Green.\nThe supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in \"the act of benediction\". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold mural crown between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.\nThe arms were re-matriculated by the City of Glasgow District Council on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996. The only change made on each occasion was in the type of coronet over the arms.[55][56]\n\n\nGovernment and politics[edit]\nMain article: Politics of Glasgow\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

The city council was controlled by the Labour Party for over thirty years, since the decline of the Progressives. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the single transferable vote rather than the first-past-the-post system, the dominance of the Labour Party within the city started to decline. As a result of the 2017 United Kingdom local elections, the SNP was able to form a minority administration ending Labour's thirty-seven years of uninterrupted control.\nIn the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at Westminster, with one uprising in January 1919 prompting the Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, to deploy 10,000 soldiers and tanks on the city's streets. A huge demonstration in the city's George Square on 31 January ended in violence after the Riot Act was read.\nIndustrial action at the shipyards gave rise to the \"Red Clydeside\" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the Independent Labour Party. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the poll tax; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the Scottish Socialist Party, another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a Conservative MP since the 1982 Hillhead by-election, when the SDP took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the Progressives) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour Lord Provost.\nGlasgow is represented in both the House of Commons in London, and the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh. At Westminster, it is represented by seven Members of Parliament (MPs), all elected at least once every five years to represent individual constituencies, using the first-past-the-post system of voting. In Holyrood, Glasgow is represented by sixteen Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), of whom nine are elected to represent individual constituencies once every four years using first-past-the-post, and seven are elected as additional regional members, by proportional representation. Since the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Glasgow is represented at Holyrood by\n9 Scottish National Party MSPs, 4 Labour MSPs, 2 Conservative MSPs and 1 Scottish Green MSP. In the European Parliament, the city formed part of the Scotland constituency, which elected six Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) prior to Brexit.\n\nCentral government[edit]\nMain article: Glasgow Parliamentary Constituencies\nSee also: Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region) and United Kingdom constituencies\nSince Glasgow is covered and operates under two separate central governments, the devolved Scottish Parliament and UK Government, they determine various matters that Glasgow City Council is not responsible for.\n\nScottish Parliament[edit]\nThe Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament covers the Glasgow City council area, a north-western part of South Lanarkshire and a small eastern portion of Renfrewshire. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 first past the post constituency members and seven of the 56 additional members. Both kinds of member are known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The system of election is designed to produce a form of proportional representation.\nThe first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing Westminster (House of Commons) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster Members of Parliament (MPs) representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of MSPs was retained at Holyrood. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn.\nCurrently, the nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region are:\n\nGlasgow Anniesland\nGlasgow Cathcart\nGlasgow Kelvin\nGlasgow Maryhill and Springburn\nGlasgow Pollok\nGlasgow Provan\nGlasgow Shettleston\nGlasgow Southside\nRutherglen\nAt the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, all nine of these constituencies were won by Scottish National Party (SNP) candidates. On the regional vote, the Glasgow electoral region is represented by four Labour MSPs, two Conservative MSPs and one Green MSP.\n\nUK Westminster Parliament[edit]\nFollowing reform of constituencies of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom (Westminster) in 2005, which reduced the number of Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs), the current Westminster constituencies representing Glasgow are:\n\nGlasgow Central\nGlasgow East\nGlasgow North\nGlasgow North East\nGlasgow North West\nGlasgow South\nGlasgow South West\nFollowing the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which 53.49% of the electorate of Glasgow voted in favour of Scottish independence; the SNP won every constituency in the city at the 2015 general election, including a record-breaking 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP in the seat of Glasgow North East.[57]\nIn the 2017 snap election, Glasgow was represented by 6 Scottish National Party MPs and 1 Labour MP; the Glasgow North East constituency which had a record 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP at the previous general election, was regained by Paul Sweeney of the Labour Party, who narrowly defeated sitting SNP MP Anne McLaughlin by 242 votes.\nSince the 2019 snap election, Glasgow has been represented by 7 Scottish National Party MPs; the Glasgow North East constituency, was regained by Anne McLaughlin of the Scottish National Party, resulting in the same clean sweep as in 2015 general election.\n\nReferendums[edit]\nIn the Scottish independence referendum, Glasgow voted \"Yes\" by a margin of 53.5% to 46.5%.\nIn the Brexit referendum, results varied from constituency to constituency. Glasgow North recorded the biggest remain vote with 78% opting to stay in the EU whilst in Glasgow East this figure dropped to 56%.[58] The city as a whole voted to remain in the EU, by 66.6% to 33.3%.[59]\n\nVoter turnout[edit]\nVoter turnout has often been lower in Glasgow than in the rest of the United Kingdom. In the Referendum of 2014 turnout was 75%, the lowest in Scotland;[60] in the Brexit referendum the city's voters, while joining the rest of Scotland in voting to remain part of the EU, again had a low turnout of 56.2%, although SNP MP Angus Robertson placed this in the historical context of traditional low turnout in Glasgow.[61]\nIn the 2015 general election, the six Scottish constituencies with the lowest turnout were all in Glasgow;[62] turnout further decreased in the 2017 election, when five of the city's seven seats reported a lowered turnout.[63]\n\nGeography[edit]\nMain article: Geography of Glasgow\nGlasgow is located on the banks of the River Clyde, in West Central Scotland. Another important river is the Kelvin, a tributary of the River Clyde, whose name was used in creating the title of Baron Kelvin the renowned physicist for whom the SI unit of temperature, Kelvin, is named.\nOn older maps Glasgow is shown within the area of the pre-1975 county of Lanarkshire; from 1975 to 1996 it appears within Strathclyde Region; more recent maps generally show Glasgow as one of 32 Council Areas in Scotland.\n\n River Clyde, west of Glasgow city centre as seen from the air\nLocation[edit]\nDestinations from Glasgow\nDumbarton, Helensburgh, Crianlarich\nAberfoyle, Callander, Crianlarich\nCumbernauld, Stirling (30\u00a0mi or 48\u00a0km), Falkirk (24\u00a0mi or 39\u00a0km)\n\n\n\n\n\nErskine, Paisley (9.3\u00a0mi or 15\u00a0km), Renfrew, Port Glasgow, Greenock\n\nGlasgow\n\nCoatbridge, Airdrie, Livingston (30\u00a0mi or 48\u00a0km), Edinburgh (47\u00a0mi or 76\u00a0km)\n\n\n\n\n\nKilmarnock, Prestwick, Ayr\nEast Kilbride (9.9\u00a0mi or 16\u00a0km), Strathaven, Cumnock, Dumfries\nMotherwell, Hamilton, Lanark, Wishaw, Carluke\n\nGlasgow is located in the central belt of Scotland.\n\nClimate[edit]\n Panorama over Glasgow's South Side and West End from Queen's Park, looking north west. Left of centre can be seen the Clyde Arc bridge at Finnieston, while beyond is the tower of the University of Glasgow, with the Campsie Fells in the distance on the right.\nDespite its northerly latitude, similar to that of Moscow, Glasgow's climate is classified as oceanic (K\u00f6ppen Cfb).\nData is available online for 3 official weather stations in the Glasgow area: Paisley, Abbotsinch and Bishopton. All are located to the west of the city, in neighbouring Renfrewshire.\nOwing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Winter temperatures are usually higher than in most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to continental Western Europe. At Paisley, the annual precipitation averages 1,245\u00a0mm (49.0\u00a0in). Glasgow has been named as the rainiest city of the UK, having an average of 170 days of rain a year.[64][65]\nWinters are cool and overcast, with a January mean of 5.0\u00a0\u00b0C (41.0\u00a0\u00b0F), though lows sometimes fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C (10\u00a0\u00b0F) in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.\nDuring the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F), and very rarely exceed 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.\nThe official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe. The warmest month on record in the data series is July 2006, with an average high of 22.7\u00a0\u00b0C (72.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and low of 13.7\u00a0\u00b0C (56.7\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] Even this extreme event only matched a normal summer on similar parallels in continental Europe, underlining the maritime influences. The coldest month on record since the data series began is December 2010, during a severe cold wave affecting the British Isles. Even then, the December high was above freezing at 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C (34.9\u00a0\u00b0F) with the low of \u22124.4\u00a0\u00b0C (24.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] This still ensured Glasgow's coldest month of 2010 remained milder than the isotherm of \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F) normally used to determine continental climate normals.\nTemperature extremes have ranged from \u221219.9\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F), at Abbotsinch in December 1995 to[67]\n31.9\u00a0\u00b0C (89\u00a0\u00b0F) at Bishopton in June 2018.[68]\n\n\n\n\n\nvteClimate data for Paisley[a], elevation: 16\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft) 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1959\u2013present\n\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n\nRecord high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n13.5(56.3)\n\n14.4(57.9)\n\n17.2(63.0)\n\n24.4(75.9)\n\n26.5(79.7)\n\n29.6(85.3)\n\n30.0(86.0)\n\n31.0(87.8)\n\n26.7(80.1)\n\n22.8(73.0)\n\n17.7(63.9)\n\n14.1(57.4)\n\n31.0(87.8)\n\n\nAverage high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n7.2(45.0)\n\n7.8(46.0)\n\n9.8(49.6)\n\n13.0(55.4)\n\n16.1(61.0)\n\n18.4(65.1)\n\n19.8(67.6)\n\n19.3(66.7)\n\n16.7(62.1)\n\n13.0(55.4)\n\n9.6(49.3)\n\n7.4(45.3)\n\n13.2(55.8)\n\n\nDaily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n4.6(40.3)\n\n5.0(41.0)\n\n6.5(43.7)\n\n9.0(48.2)\n\n11.8(53.2)\n\n14.3(57.7)\n\n15.9(60.6)\n\n15.6(60.1)\n\n13.3(55.9)\n\n9.9(49.8)\n\n6.9(44.4)\n\n4.7(40.5)\n\n9.8(49.6)\n\n\nAverage low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n2.1(35.8)\n\n2.2(36.0)\n\n3.2(37.8)\n\n5.1(41.2)\n\n7.4(45.3)\n\n10.3(50.5)\n\n12.1(53.8)\n\n11.9(53.4)\n\n9.9(49.8)\n\n6.8(44.2)\n\n4.2(39.6)\n\n2.1(35.8)\n\n6.5(43.7)\n\n\nRecord low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n\u221214.8(5.4)\n\n\u22127.5(18.5)\n\n\u22128.3(17.1)\n\n\u22124.4(24.1)\n\n\u22121.1(30.0)\n\n1.5(34.7)\n\n3.9(39.0)\n\n2.2(36.0)\n\n\u22120.2(31.6)\n\n\u22123.5(25.7)\n\n\u22126.8(19.8)\n\n\u221214.5(5.9)\n\n\u221214.8(5.4)\n\n\nAverage precipitation mm (inches)\n\n146.4(5.76)\n\n115.2(4.54)\n\n97.4(3.83)\n\n66.1(2.60)\n\n68.8(2.71)\n\n67.8(2.67)\n\n82.9(3.26)\n\n94.8(3.73)\n\n98.4(3.87)\n\n131.8(5.19)\n\n131.8(5.19)\n\n161.4(6.35)\n\n1,262.8(49.72)\n\n\nAverage precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm)\n\n17.7\n\n14.7\n\n13.8\n\n12.3\n\n12.1\n\n12.1\n\n13.3\n\n13.9\n\n13.9\n\n16.2\n\n17.3\n\n16.9\n\n174.3\n\n\nMean monthly sunshine hours\n\n38.6\n\n67.3\n\n104.3\n\n141.4\n\n186.8\n\n155.6\n\n151.5\n\n145.5\n\n114.6\n\n86.3\n\n53.9\n\n33.7\n\n1,279.6\n\n\nSource 1: Met Office [69]\n\n\nSource 2: KNMI/Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute[70]\n\n\n\n\n\nvteClimate data for Abbotsinch[b], elevation: 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1951\u2013present\n\n\nMonth\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n\nRecord high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n13.5(56.3)\n\n14.3(57.7)\n\n18.9(66.0)\n\n24.0(75.2)\n\n27.4(81.3)\n\n29.6(85.3)\n\n30.1(86.2)\n\n31.2(88.2)\n\n26.7(80.1)\n\n23.9(75.0)\n\n16.0(60.8)\n\n14.6(58.3)\n\n31.2(88.2)\n\n\nAverage high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n6.7(44.1)\n\n7.4(45.3)\n\n9.2(48.6)\n\n12.2(54.0)\n\n15.4(59.7)\n\n17.8(64.0)\n\n19.3(66.7)\n\n18.9(66.0)\n\n16.5(61.7)\n\n12.8(55.0)\n\n9.3(48.7)\n\n6.8(44.2)\n\n12.7(54.9)\n\n\nDaily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n4.1(39.4)\n\n4.5(40.1)\n\n5.9(42.6)\n\n8.2(46.8)\n\n10.9(51.6)\n\n13.6(56.5)\n\n15.3(59.5)\n\n14.9(58.8)\n\n12.9(55.2)\n\n9.6(49.3)\n\n6.4(43.5)\n\n4.1(39.4)\n\n9.2(48.6)\n\n\nAverage low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n1.5(34.7)\n\n1.6(34.9)\n\n2.6(36.7)\n\n4.2(39.6)\n\n6.5(43.7)\n\n9.4(48.9)\n\n11.2(52.2)\n\n10.9(51.6)\n\n9.2(48.6)\n\n6.4(43.5)\n\n3.6(38.5)\n\n1.4(34.5)\n\n5.7(42.3)\n\n\nRecord low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n\n\u221217.4(0.7)\n\n\u221215.0(5.0)\n\n\u221212.5(9.5)\n\n\u22125.4(22.3)\n\n\u22123.9(25.0)\n\n1.2(34.2)\n\n0.8(33.4)\n\n1.1(34.0)\n\n\u22124.0(24.8)\n\n\u22127.1(19.2)\n\n\u221210.4(13.3)\n\n\u221219.9(\u22123.8)\n\n\u221219.9(\u22123.8)\n\n\nAverage precipitation mm (inches)\n\n157.3(6.19)\n\n125.0(4.92)\n\n112.4(4.43)\n\n73.2(2.88)\n\n71.9(2.83)\n\n80.8(3.18)\n\n91.9(3.62)\n\n107.1(4.22)\n\n109.4(4.31)\n\n135.7(5.34)\n\n145.0(5.71)\n\n160.7(6.33)\n\n1,370.2(53.94)\n\n\nAverage precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm)\n\n18.2\n\n15.2\n\n14.9\n\n12.6\n\n12.2\n\n12.8\n\n13.4\n\n14.5\n\n14.3\n\n17.2\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\n181.2\n\n\nMean monthly sunshine hours\n\n45.9\n\n70.0\n\n106.1\n\n148.2\n\n197.2\n\n159.2\n\n162.7\n\n152.9\n\n117.9\n\n84.9\n\n57.5\n\n41.7\n\n1,344.1\n\n\nSource: Met Office[71]\n\n\nDemographics[edit]\n Greater Glasgow population density map\nMain articles: Demography of Glasgow and Geography of Glasgow \u00a7\u00a0Demographics\nFurther information: Glasgow effect\nIn the 1950s, the population of the City of Glasgow area peaked at 1,089,000. Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the Gorbals and relocation to \"new towns\" such as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld led to population decline. In addition, the boundaries of the city were changed twice during the late-twentieth century, making direct comparisons difficult.\nThe urban area continues to expand beyond the city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, encompassing around 400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,040\u00a0km2) of all adjoining suburbs, if commuter towns and villages are included.[72] There are two distinct definitions for the population of Glasgow: the Glasgow City Council Area which lost the districts of Rutherglen and Cambuslang to South Lanarkshire in 1996, and the Greater Glasgow Urban Area which includes the conurbation around the city (however in the 2016 definitions[73] the aforementioned Rutherglen and Cambuslang were included along with the likes of Paisley, Clydebank, Newton Mearns, Bearsden and Stepps but not others with no continuity of populated postcodes \u2013 although in some cases the gap is small \u2013 the excluded nearby settlements including Barrhead, Erskine and Kirkintilloch plus a large swathe of Lanarkshire which had been considered contiguous with Glasgow in previous definitions: the 'settlements' named Coatbridge & Airdrie, Hamilton and Motherwell & Wishaw, each containing a number of distinct smaller localities).[3]\n\n\n\nLocation\n\nPopulation\n\nArea\n\nDensity\n\n\nGlasgow City Council[74]\n\n592,820\n\n67.76\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (175.5\u00a0km2)\n\n8,541.8/sq\u00a0mi (3,298.0/km2)\n\n\nGreater Glasgow Urban Area[3]\n\n985,290\n\n265\u00a0km2 (102\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n\n3,775/km2 (9,780/sq\u00a0mi)\n\n\nSource: Scotland's Census Results Online[75]\n\nGlasgow's population influx in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was related to economic expansion as well as internally generated growth with the vast majority of newcomers to the city from outside Scotland being from Ireland, especially the north western counties of Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Londonderry. In the 1881 UK Census, 83% of the population was born in Scotland, 13% in Ireland, 3% in England and 1% elsewhere. By 1911, the city was no longer gaining population by migration. The demographic percentages in the 1951 UK census were: born in Scotland 93%, Ireland 3%, England 3% and elsewhere 1%.[20] In the early twentieth century, many Lithuanian refugees began to settle in Glasgow and at its height in the 1950s; there were around 10,000 in the Glasgow area.[76] Many Italian Scots also settled in Glasgow, originating from provinces like Frosinone in Lazio and Lucca in north-west Tuscany at this time, many originally working as \"Hokey Pokey\" men.[77]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population of Glasgow and city limits\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population and city limits\n\n\nYear[78]\n\nPopulation\n\nArea  (km2)\n\nDensity  (inhabitants/km2)\n\nArea changes\n\n\n1300\n1,500\n-[79]\n\u2013\nInitial\n\n\n1600\n7,000\n\u2013\n\u2013\nUnknown\n\n\n1791\n66,000\n7.16\n9,217\nAnderson to James Street/West Nile Street to Camlachie\n\n\n1831\n202,426\n8.83\n22,924\nNecropolis and Blythswood\n\n\n1846\n280,000\n23.44\n11,945\nBurghs of Anderston and Calton/Barony of Gorbals\n\n\n1872\n494,824\n24.42\n20,263\nDistricts of Keppochhill, Alexandra Parade and the new Glasgow University grounds\n\n\n1891\n658,073\n48.00\n13,709\nBurghs of Govanhill, Crosshill, Pollokshields, Maryhill and Hillhead.

The population of the city council area was 593,245 in 2011[82] and around 2,300,000 people live in the Glasgow travel to work area.[83] This area is defined as consisting of over 10% of residents travelling into Glasgow to work and is without fixed boundaries.[84]\nThe population density of London following the 2011 census was recorded as 5,200 people per square kilometre, while 3,395 people per square kilometre were registered in Glasgow.[85][86] In 1931, the population density was 16,166/sq\u00a0mi (6,242/km2), highlighting the \"clearances\" into the suburbs and new towns that were built to reduce the size of one of Europe's most densely populated cities.[87]\nIn 2005, Glasgow had the lowest life expectancy of any UK city at 72.9 years.[88] Much was made of this during the 2008 Glasgow East by-election.[89] In 2008, a World Health Organization report about health inequalities, revealing that male life expectancy varied from 54 years in Calton to 82 years in nearby Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire.[90][91]\n\nAreas and suburbs[edit]\n Areas of Glasgow. Click to enlarge.\nCity centre[edit]\n The Clyde Arc, also known locally as the \"Squinty Bridge\"\nThe city centre is bounded by High Street up to Glasgow Cathedral at Castle Street, Glasgow Cross, Saltmarket including Glasgow Green and St Andrew's Square to the east; Clyde Street and Broomielaw (along the River Clyde) to the south; and Charing Cross and Elmbank Street, beyond Blythswood Square to the west.  The northern boundary (from east to west) follows Cathedral Street to North Hanover Street and George Square.\n\nRetail and theatre district[edit]\n Looking down Buchanan Street towards St Enoch subway station\nThe city centre is based on a grid system of streets on the north bank of the River Clyde. The heart of the city is George Square, site of many of Glasgow's public statues and the elaborate Victorian Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of Glasgow City Council. To the south and west are the shopping precincts of Argyle Street, Sauchiehall Street and Buchanan Street, the last featuring more upmarket retailers and winner of the Academy of Urbanism \"Great Street Award\" 2008.[92] The collection of shops around these streets accumulate to become known as \"The Style Mile\".[93]\nThe main shopping areas include Buchanan Street, Buchanan Galleries, linking Buchanan Street and Sauchiehall Street,  and the St. Enoch Centre linking Argyle Street and St Enoch Square), with the up-market Princes Square, which specifically features shops such as Ted Baker, Radley and Kurt Geiger.[94]  Buchanan Galleries and other city centre locales were chosen as locations for the 2013 film Under the Skin directed by Jonathan Glazer.[95] Although the Glasgow scenes were shot with hidden cameras, star Scarlett Johansson was spotted around town.[96] The Italian Centre in Ingram Street also specialises in designer labels. Glasgow's retail portfolio forms the UK's second largest and most economically important retail sector after Central London.[97][98]\nThe city centre is home to most of Glasgow's main cultural venues: the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow City Hall, Theatre Royal (performing home of Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet), the Pavilion Theatre, the King's Theatre, Glasgow Film Theatre, Tron Theatre, Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), Mitchell Library and Theatre, the Centre for Contemporary Arts, McLellan Galleries and the Lighthouse Museum of Architecture. The world's tallest cinema, the eighteen-screen Cineworld, is situated on Renfrew Street.\nThe city centre is also home to four of Glasgow's higher education institutions: the University of Strathclyde, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow School of Art and Glasgow Caledonian University, and to the largest college in Britain the City of Glasgow College in Cathedral Street.\n\nMerchant City[edit]\n The Tolbooth Steeple dominates Glasgow Cross and marks the east side of the Merchant City.\nThis is the commercial and part-residential district of the Merchant City, a name coined by the historian Charles Oakley in the 1960s. This had started as a residential district of the wealthy city merchants involved in international trade and the textile industries in the 18th and early 19th centuries, with their warehouses nearby, including the Tobacco Lords from whom many of the streets take their name. With its mercantile wealth, and continuing growth even before the Industrial Revolution, the city expanded by creating the New Town around George Square, soon followed by the New Town of Blythswood on Blythswood Hill which includes Blythswood Square.[99] The original medieval centre around Glasgow Cross and the High Street was left behind.\nGlasgow Cross, situated at the junction of High Street, leading up to Glasgow Cathedral, Gallowgate, Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its Mercat cross. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Steeple, all that remains of the original Glasgow Tolbooth, which was demolished in 1921. Moving northward up High Street towards Rottenrow and Townhead lies the 15th century Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand's Lordship. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.[100]\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre flats and warehouse conversions. This regeneration has supported an increasing number of caf\u00e9s and restaurants.[101] The area is also home to a number of high end boutique style shops and some of Glasgow's most upmarket stores.[102]\nThe Merchant City is one centre of Glasgow's growing \"cultural quarter\", based on King Street, the Saltmarket and Trongate, and at the heart of the annual Merchant City Festival. The area has supported a growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces.[103] The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a \"cultural quarter\" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and Glasgow City Council,[103] and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both.[104] The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the Tron Theatre, the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the City Halls.[105]\n\nInternational Financial Services District[edit]\nFurther information: International Financial Services District\n The International Financial Services District alongside the River Clyde\nTo the western edge of the city centre, occupying the areas of Blythswood Hill and Anderston, lies Glasgow's financial district, known officially as the International Financial Services District (IFSD), although often irreverently nicknamed by the contemporary press as the \"square kilometre\" or \"Wall Street on Clyde\".[106] Since the late 1980s the construction of many modern office blocks and high rise developments have paved the way for the IFSD to become one of the UK's largest financial quarters. With a reputation as an established financial services centre, coupled with comprehensive support services, Glasgow continues to attract and grow new business.\nOf the 10 largest general insurance companies in the UK, 8 have a base or head office in Glasgow\u00a0\u2014 including Direct Line, Esure, AXA and Norwich Union. Key banking sector companies have also moved some of their services to commercial property in Glasgow\u00a0\u2013 Resolution, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays Wealth, Tesco Personal Finance, Morgan Stanley, Lloyds Banking Group, Clydesdale Bank, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Santander and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Ministry of Defence have several departments and Clydeport, the Glasgow Stock Exchange, Student Loans Company, Scottish Executive Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, BT Group, Scottish Friendly. Scottish Qualifications Authority and Scottish Enterprise also have their headquarters in the district. Royal Dutch Shell also have one of their six worldwide Shared Business Centres located in the IFSD. Hilton have a corporate office based in the area.\n\nWest End[edit]\n Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is Glasgow's premier museum and art gallery, housing one of Europe's best civic art collections.\nGlasgow's West End grew firstly to and around Blythswood Square and Garnethill, extending then to Woodlands Hill and Great Western Road. It is a district of elegant townhouses and tenements with caf\u00e9s, tea rooms, bars, boutiques, upmarket hotels, clubs and restaurants in the hinterland of Kelvingrove Park, the University of Glasgow, Glasgow Botanic Gardens and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, focused especially on the area's main thoroughfares of Argyle Street (Finnieston), Great Western Road and Byres Road. The area is popular with tourists and students.\nThe West End includes residential areas of Hillhead, Dowanhill, Kelvingrove, Kelvinside, Hyndland, Broomhill, Scotstoun, Jordanhill, Kelvindale and Anniesland\nand, to an increasing extent, Partick. The name is also increasingly being used to refer to any area to the west of Charing Cross. The West End is bisected by the River Kelvin, which flows from the Campsie Fells in the north and confluences with the River Clyde at Yorkhill Quay.\nThe spire of Sir George Gilbert Scott's Glasgow University main building (the second largest Gothic Revival building in Great Britain) is a major landmark, and can be seen from miles around, sitting atop Gilmorehill. The university itself is the fourth oldest in the English-speaking world. Much of the city's student population is based in the West End, adding to its cultural vibrancy.\nThe area is also home to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Kelvin Hall museums and research facilities, stores, and community sport.  Adjacent to the Kelvin Hall was the Museum of Transport, which reopened in 2010 after moving to a new location on a former dockland site at Glasgow Harbour where the River Kelvin flows into the Clyde. The new building is built to a design by Zaha Hadid. The West End Festival, one of Glasgow's largest festivals, is held annually in June.\nGlasgow is the home of the SECC, Great Britain's largest exhibition and conference centre.[107][108][109] On 30 September 2013, a major expansion of the SECC facilities at the former Queen's Dock by Foster and Partners officially opened \u2013 the 13,000-seat Hydro arena. Adjacent to the SECC at Queen's Dock is the Clydeside distillery, a Scotch whisky distillery that opened in 2017 in the former dock pump house.[110]\n\nEast End[edit]\n People's Palace museum on Glasgow Green\nThe East End extends from Glasgow Cross in the City Centre to the boundary with North and South Lanarkshire. It is home to the Glasgow Barrowland market, popularly known as \"The Barras\",[111] Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow Green, and Celtic Park, home of Celtic FC. Many of the original sandstone tenements remain in this district. The East End was once a major industrial centre, home to Sir William Arrol & Co., James Templeton & Co and William Beardmore and Company. A notable local employer continues to be the Wellpark Brewery, home of Tennent's Lager.\nThe Glasgow Necropolis Garden Cemetery was created by the Merchants House on a hill above the cathedral in 1831. Routes curve through the landscape uphill to the 21.3-metre-high (70\u00a0ft)[112] statue of John Knox at the summit. There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by David Dale, whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern Gillespie, Kidd & Coia building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as \"Homes for the Future\", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.[113]\nEast of Glasgow Cross is St Andrew's in the Square, the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739\u20131757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy tobacco merchants. Also close by is the more modest Episcopalian St Andrew's-by-the-Green, the oldest Episcopal church in Scotland. The Episcopalian St Andrew's was also known as the \"Whistlin' Kirk\" due to it being the first church after the Reformation to own an organ.\n\n The Doulton Fountain\u00a0[de] in Glasgow Green\nOverlooking Glasgow Green is the fa\u00e7ade of Templeton On The Green, featuring vibrant polychromatic brickwork intended to evoke the Doge's Palace in Venice.[114]\nThe extensive Tollcross Park was originally developed from the estate of James Dunlop, the owner of a local steelworks. His large baronial mansion was built in 1848 by David Bryce, which later housed the city's Children's Museum until the 1980s. Today, the mansion is a sheltered housing complex.\nThe new Scottish National Indoor Sports Arena, a modern replacement for the Kelvin Hall, is in Dalmarnock. The area was the site of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, located adjacent to the new indoor sports arena.\nThe East End Healthy Living Centre (EEHLC) was established in mid-2005 at Crownpoint Road with Lottery Funding and City grants to serve community needs in the area. Now called the Glasgow Club Crownpoint Sports Complex, the centre provides service such as sports facilities, health advice, stress management, leisure and vocational classes.[115] To the north of the East End lie the two large gasometers of Provan Gas Works, which stand overlooking Alexandra Park and a major interchange between the M8 and M80 motorways.[116][117][118]\n\nSouth Side[edit]\n Pacific Quay sits within the south side of Glasgow, and is home to some of the city's largest businesses and employers.\nGlasgow's South Side sprawls out south of the Clyde. The adjoining urban area includes some of Greater Glasgow's most affluent suburban towns, such as Newton Mearns, Clarkston, and Giffnock, all of which are in East Renfrewshire, as well as Thorntonhall in South Lanarkshire. Newlands and Dumbreck are examples of high-value residential districts within the city boundaries. There are many areas containing a high concentration of sandstone tenements, examples being Battlefield, Govanhill, Mount Florida and Shawlands. The large suburb of Pollokshields comprises both a quiet western part with undulating tree-lined boulevards lined with expensive villas, and a busier eastern part with a high-density grid of tenements and small shops. The south side also includes some post-war housing estates of various sizes such as Toryglen, Pollok, Castlemilk and Arden. The towns of Cambuslang and Rutherglen were included in the City of Glasgow district from 1975 to 1996, but are now in the South Lanarkshire council area.[119][120][121]\nAlthough predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Scotland Street School Museum and House for an Art Lover; the Burrell Collection in Pollok Country Park; Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson's Holmwood House villa; the National Football Stadium Hampden Park in Mount Florida (home of Queens Park FC) and Ibrox Stadium (home of Rangers FC).\nThe former docklands site at Pacific Quay on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the Glasgow Science Centre and the headquarters of BBC Scotland and STV Group (owner of STV), in a new purpose built digital media campus.\nIn addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built, including the Clyde Arc known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at Pacific Quay and others at Tradeston and Springfield Quay.\nThe South Side also includes many public parks, including Linn Park, Queen's Park, and Bellahouston Park and several golf clubs, including the championship course at Haggs Castle. The South Side is also home to the large Pollok Country Park, which was awarded the accolade of Europe's Best Park 2008.[122] The southside also directly borders Rouken Glen Park in neighbouring Giffnock. Pollok Park is Glasgow's largest park and until the early 2000s was the only country park in the city's boundary. In the early 2000s the Dams to Darnley Country Park was designated, although half of the park is in East Renfrewshire. As of 2021 the facilities at the still new park are quite lacking.\nGovan is a district and former burgh in the south-western part of the city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is home to one of two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system. The wider Govan area includes the districts of Ibrox, Cessnock, Kinning Park and Kingston.\n\nNorth Glasgow[edit]\n Ruchill Church, seen from the Forth and Clyde Canal\nNorth Glasgow extends out from the north of the city centre towards the affluent suburbs of Bearsden, Milngavie and Bishopbriggs in East Dunbartonshire and Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire. The area also contains some of the city's poorest residential areas. Possilpark is one such district, where levels of unemployment and drug abuse continue to be above the national average. Much of the housing in areas such as Possilpark and Hamiltonhill have fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years.[citation needed]\nThis has led to large-scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in north Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as Ruchill, which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern housing estates. Much of the housing stock in north Glasgow is rented social housing, with a high proportion of high-rise tower blocks, managed by the North Glasgow Housing Association trading as NG Homes and Glasgow Housing Association.\nMaryhill consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the north of the city, containing affluent areas such as Maryhill Park and North Kelvinside. Maryhill is also the location of Firhill Stadium, home of Partick Thistle F.C. since 1909. The junior team, Maryhill F.C. are also located in this part of north Glasgow.\nThe Forth and Clyde Canal passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy. It was for many years polluted and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation have seen it rejuvenated, including art campuses at Port Dundas.\nSighthill was home to Scotland's largest asylum seeker community but the area is now regenerated as part of the Youth Olympic Games bid.[123]\nA huge part of the economic life of Glasgow was once located in Springburn, where the Saracen Foundry, engineering works of firms like Charles Tennant and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the North British Locomotive Company. Today part of the Glasgow Works continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn. It is proposed for closure in 2019.[124]\n\nCulture[edit]\nSee also: Culture in Glasgow\n Established by wealthy tobacco merchant Stephen Mitchell, the Mitchell Library is now one of the largest public reference libraries in Europe\nThe city has many amenities for a wide range of cultural activities, from curling to opera and ballet and from football to art appreciation; it also has a large selection of museums that include those devoted to transport, religion, and modern art. Many of the city's cultural sites were celebrated in 1990 when Glasgow was designated European Capital of Culture.[125]\nThe city's principal municipal library, the Mitchell Library, has grown into one of the largest public reference libraries in Europe, currently housing some 1.3\u00a0million books, an extensive collection of newspapers and thousands of photographs and maps.[126]\nOf academic libraries, Glasgow University Library started in the 15th century and is one of the oldest and largest libraries in Europe, with unique and distinctive collections of international status.[127]\nMost of Scotland's national arts organisations are based in Glasgow, including Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, National Theatre of Scotland, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Scottish Youth Theatre.\nGlasgow has its own \"Poet Laureate\", a post created in 1999 for Edwin Morgan[128] and occupied by Liz Lochhead from 2005[129] until 2011, when she stood down to take up the position of Scots Makar.[130] Jim Carruth was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate for Glasgow in 2014 as part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy.[131]\nIn 2013, PETA declared Glasgow to be the most vegan-friendly city in the UK.[132]\n\nRecreation[edit]\nSee also: Glasgow Festivals\nGlasgow is home to a variety of theatres including the King's Theatre, the Theatre Royal and the Citizens Theatre and is home to many museums and art galleries, the largest and most famous being the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) and the Burrell Collection. Most of the museums and galleries in Glasgow are publicly owned and free to enter.\nThe city has hosted many exhibitions over the years, including The Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988,  being the UK City of Architecture 1999, European Capital of Culture 1990, National City of Sport 1995\u20131999 and European Capital of Sport 2003. Glasgow has also hosted the National M\u00f2d no less than twelve times since 1895.[133]\nIn addition, unlike the older and larger Edinburgh Festival (where all Edinburgh's main festivals occur in the last three weeks of August), Glasgow's festivals fill the calendar. Festivals include the Glasgow International Comedy Festival, Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art, Glasgow International Jazz Festival, Celtic Connections, Glasgow Fair, Glasgow Film Festival, West End Festival, Merchant City Festival, Glasgay, and the World Pipe Band Championships.\n\nMusic scene[edit]\nSee also: List of bands from Glasgow\n The OVO Hydro arena is the second-busiest arena venue in the world.[134]\nThe city is home to numerous orchestras, ensembles and bands including those of Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and related to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the Universities and Colleges. Choirs of all type are well supported.\nGlasgow has many live music venues, pubs, and clubs. Some of the city's more well-known venues include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, The OVO Hydro, the SECC, Glasgow Cathouse, The Art School, King Tut's Wah Wah Hut (where Oasis were spotted and signed by Glaswegian record mogul Alan McGee), the Queen Margaret Union (who have Kurt Cobain's footprint locked in a safe), the Barrowland, a ballroom converted into a live music venue as well as The Garage, which is the largest nightclub in Scotland. More recent mid-sized venues include ABC, destroyed in the art school fire of 15 June 2018, and the O2 Academy, which play host to a similar range of acts. There are also a large number of smaller venues and bars, which host many local and touring musicians, including Stereo, 13th Note and Nice N Sleazy. Most recent recipient of the SLTN Music Pub of the Year award was Bar Bloc, awarded in November 2011.[135] In 2010, Glasgow was named the UK's fourth \"most musical\" city by PRS for Music.[136] Glasgow is also the \"most mentioned city in the UK\" in song titles, outside London according, to a chart produced by PRS for music, with 119, ahead of closest rivals Edinburgh who received 95 mentions[137]\n\n View of the entrance to the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall\nSince the 1980s, the success of bands such as The Blue Nile, Gun, Simple Minds, Del Amitri, Texas, Hipsway, Love & Money, Idlewild, Deacon Blue, Orange Juice, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, Teenage Fanclub, Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, Franz Ferdinand, Mogwai, Travis, and Primal Scream has significantly boosted the profile of the Glasgow music scene, prompting Time magazine to liken Glasgow to Detroit during its 1960s Motown heyday.[138] More recent[when?] successes include The Fratellis, Chvrches, Rustie, Vukovi, Glasvegas and Twin Atlantic. The city of Glasgow was appointed a UNESCO City of Music on 20 August 2008 as part of the Creative Cities Network.\nGlasgow's contemporary dance music scene has been spearheaded by Slam, and their record label Soma Quality Recordings,[139] with their Pressure club nights attracting DJs and clubbers from around the world, which was previously held at The Arches but following that venue's closure due to claims of unsafe level of drug use has moved to Sub Club.\nThe MOBO Awards were held at the SECC on 30 September 2009, making Glasgow the first out-of-London city to host the event since its launch in 1995. On 9 November 2014, Glasgow hosted the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards at The OVO Hydro, it was the second time Scotland hosted the show since 2003 in Edinburgh and overall the fifth time that the United Kingdom has hosted the show since 2011 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The event was hosted by Nicki Minaj and featured performances from Ariana Grande, Enrique Iglesias, Ed Sheeran, U2 and Slash.\n\nMedia[edit]\nMain article: Media in Glasgow\n Glasgow is home to the HQ of BBC Scotland in Pacific Quay\n STV has its HQ located in Glasgow\nThere have been hundreds of films made about Glasgow or in Glasgow.[140]\nBoth BBC Scotland and STV have their headquarters in Glasgow. Television programs filmed in Glasgow include Rab C. Nesbitt, Taggart, Tutti Frutti, High Times, River City, City Lights, Chewin' the Fat, Still Game, Limmy's Show and Lovesick. Most recently the long-running series Question Time and the early evening quiz programme Eggheads moved its production base to the city. Most National Lottery game shows are also filmed in Glasgow. children's game show Copycats is filmed there, and the Irish/UK programme Mrs. Brown's Boys is filmed at BBC Scotland.\nThe Scottish press publishes various newspapers in the city such as The Evening Times , The Herald, The Sunday Herald, the Sunday Mail and the Daily Record. Scottish editions of Trinity Mirror and News International titles are printed in the city. STV Group is a Glasgow-based media conglomerate with interests in television, and publishing advertising. STV Group owns and operates both Scottish ITV franchises (Central Scotland and Grampian), both branded STV. Glasgow also had its own television channel, STV Glasgow, which launched in June 2014, which also shows some of Glasgow's own programs filmed at the STV headquarters in Glasgow. Shows included The Riverside Show, Scottish Kitchen, City Safari, Football Show and Live at Five. STV Glasgow merged with STV Edinburgh to form STV2 in April 2017 which eventually closed in June 2018.\nVarious radio stations are also located in Glasgow. BBC Radio Scotland, the national radio broadcaster for Scotland, is located in the BBC's Glasgow headquarters alongside its Gaelic-language sister station, which is also based in Stornoway. Bauer Radio owns the principal commercial radio stations in Glasgow: Clyde 1 and Clyde 2, which can reach over 2.3\u00a0million listeners.[141] In 2004, STV Group plc (then known as SMG plc) sold its 27.8% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings to the broadcasting group EMAP for \u00a390.5\u00a0million.

The Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church are the two largest Christian denominations in the city. There are 147 congregations in the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow (of which 104 are within the city boundaries, the other 43 being in adjacent areas).[142] Within the city boundaries there are 65 parishes of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow[143] and four parishes of the Diocese of Motherwell.[144] The city has four Christian cathedrals: Glasgow Cathedral, of the Church of Scotland; St Andrew's Cathedral, of the Roman Catholic Church; St Mary's Cathedral, of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and St Luke's Cathedral, of the Greek Orthodox Church. The Baptist Church and Salvation Army are well represented.\n\n Glasgow Cathedral marks the site where Saint Mungo built his church and established Glasgow\nThe Protestant churches are the largest in number, including Baptist, Episcopalian, Methodist and Presbyterian. 32% of the population follow the Protestant Church of Scotland whilst 29% following the Roman Catholic Church, according to the 2001 census (Christians overall form 65%).[145] Much of the city's Roman Catholic population are those of Irish ancestry. The divisions between the two denominations and their respective communities play a major part in sectarianism in Glasgow, in a similar nature to that of Northern Ireland, although not segregated territorially as in Belfast.[146][147]\nBiblical unitarians are represented by three Christadelphian ecclesias, referred to geographically, as \"South\",[148] \"Central\"[149] and \"Kelvin\".[150]\nThe Sikh community is served by four Gurdwaras. Two are situated in the West End (Central Gurdwara Singh Sabha in Sandyford and Guru Nanak Sikh Temple in Kelvinbridge) and two in the Southside area of Pollokshields (Guru Granth Sahib Gurdwara and Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Gurdwara). In 2013, Scotland's first purpose-built Gurdwara opened in a massive opening ceremony. Built at a cost of \u00a33.8M, it can hold 1,500 worshippers.[151] Central Gurdwara is currently constructing a new building in the city. There are almost 10,000 Sikhs in Scotland and the majority live in Glasgow.[152]\nGlasgow Central Mosque in the Gorbals district is the largest mosque in Scotland and, along with twelve other mosques in the city, caters for the city's Muslim population, estimated to number 33,000.[153]\nGlasgow also has a Hindu mandir.\nGlasgow has seven synagogues, including the Romanesque-revival Garnethill Synagogue in the city centre. Glasgow currently has the seventh largest Jewish population in the United Kingdom after London, Manchester, Leeds, Gateshead, Brighton and Bournemouth but once had a Jewish population second only to London, estimated at 20,000 in the Gorbals alone.[154]\nIn 1993, the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art opened in Glasgow. It is believed to be the only public museum to examine all the world's major religious faiths.[155][156]\n\nLanguage[edit]\nGlasgow is Scotland's main locus of Gaelic language use outside the Highlands and Islands. In 2011, 5,878 residents of the city over age 3 spoke Gaelic, amounting to 1.0% of the population. Of Scotland's 25 largest cities and towns, only Inverness, the unofficial capital of the Highlands, has a higher percentage of Gaelic speakers.[157] In the Greater Glasgow area there were 8,899 Gaelic-speakers, amounting to 0.8% of the population.[158] Both the Gaelic language television station BBC Alba and the Gaelic language radio station BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal have studios in Glasgow, their only locations outside the Highlands and Islands.[159]\n\nArchitecture[edit]\nMain article: Architecture in Glasgow\nClockwise, from upper left: The People's Palace is an example of 19th-century architecture within the city centre of Glasgow. The People's Palace is a Category A listed building. The SEC Armadillo opened in 1997 and is considered an iconic Glasgow structure, frequently being used as an image to represent the city nationally and internationally. The Glasgow Science Centre and Glasgow Tower in the Pacific Quay area of the city, an example of modern design within the city as part of regeneration efforts. New high-rise apartment blocks have been constructed through Glasgow, such as on the banks of the River Clyde to replace the ageing Glasgow tower blocks constructed during the 1960s.\nVery little of medieval Glasgow remains; the two main landmarks from this period being the 15th-century Provand's Lordship and 13th-century St. Mungo's Cathedral, although the original medieval street plan (along with many of the street names) on the eastern side of the city centre has largely survived intact. Also in the 15th century began the building of Cathcart Castle, completed c. 1450 with an impressive view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle Mary Queen of Scots supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the Battle of Langside in May 1568. The castle was demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the central city area as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of Victorian architecture: the Glasgow City Chambers; the main building of the University of Glasgow, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott; and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, designed by Sir John W. Simpson, are notable examples.\nThe city is notable for architecture designed by the Glasgow School, the most notable exponent of that style being Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mackintosh was an architect and designer in the Arts and Crafts Movement and the main exponent of Art Nouveau in the United Kingdom, designing numerous noted Glasgow buildings such as the Glasgow School of Art, Willow Tearooms and the Scotland Street School Museum. A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the Queen's Cross Church, the only church by the renowned artist to be built.[160]\nAnother architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance is Alexander Thomson, with notable examples including the Holmwood House villa, and likewise Sir John James Burnet, awarded the R.I.B.A.'s Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the \"Second City of the Empire\". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The shipyards, marine engineering, steel making, and heavy industry all contributed to the growth of the city.\nMany of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond sandstone, but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the furnaces, until the Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956. In recent years many of these buildings have been cleaned and restored to their original appearance.[citation needed] There are over 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over 1,471 hectares (3,630 acres). Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields \u2013 the first major planned garden suburb in Britain \u2013 Newlands and the village of Carmunnock.[161]\nModern buildings in Glasgow include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and along the banks of the Clyde are the Glasgow Science Centre, The OVO Hydro and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, whose Clyde Auditorium was designed by Sir Norman Foster, and is colloquially known as the \"Armadillo\". In 2006 Zaha Hadid won a competition to design the new Museum of Transport.[162] Hadid's museum opened on the waterfront in 2011 and has been renamed the Riverside Museum to reflect the change in location and to celebrate Glasgow's rich industrial heritage stemming from the Clyde.[163]\nGlasgow's impressive historical and modern architectural traditions were celebrated in 1999 when the city was designated UK City of Architecture and Design,[164] winning the accolade over Liverpool and Edinburgh.[165]\n\nEconomy[edit]\n RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, better known as the QE2, was built in Glasgow at the John Brown Shipyard on the River Clyde.\n RMS\u00a0Queen Mary is largely regarded as a sign of Glaswegian powerhouse shipbuilding industry.\nGlasgow has the largest economy in Scotland[13] and is at the hub of the metropolitan area of West Central Scotland. Glasgow also has the third highest GDP Per capita of any city in the UK (after London and Edinburgh).[14][needs update] The city itself sustains more than 410,000 jobs in over 12,000 companies. Over 153,000 jobs were created in the city between 2000 and 2005\u00a0\u2013 a growth rate of 32%.[166] Glasgow's annual economic growth rate of 4.4% is now second only to that of London. In 2005, over 17,000 new jobs were created, and 2006 saw private-sector investment in the city reaching \u00a34.2\u00a0billion, an increase of 22% in a single year.[167] 55% of the residents in the Greater Glasgow area commute to the city every day. Once dominant export orientated manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding and other heavy engineering have been gradually replaced in importance by more diversified forms of economic activity, although major manufacturing firms continue to be headquartered in the city, such as Aggreko, Weir Group, Clyde Blowers, Howden, Linn Products, Firebrand Games, William Grant & Sons, Whyte and Mackay, The Edrington Group, British Polar Engines and Albion Motors.[168]\nGlasgow was once one of the most significant cities in the UK for manufacturing, which generated a great deal of the city's wealth; the most prominent industry being shipbuilding based on the River Clyde.[169] Among the historic vessels constructed there were the famed tea clipper Cutty Sark, the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS\u00a0Hood, and the transatlantic luxury liners Aquitania, RMS\u00a0Queen Mary, RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth, and RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II. Although Glasgow owed much of its economic growth to the shipbuilding industry, which still continues today in the form of Ferguson Marine and BAE Systems Maritime - Naval Ships' two shipyards, the city has its roots in the tobacco trade and is noted to have \"risen from its medieval slumber\" from trade in tobacco, pioneered by figures such as John Glassford.[170] The city was also noted for its locomotive construction industry\u2014led by firms such as the North British Locomotive Company\u2014which grew during the 19th century before entering a decline in the 1960s.\n\n A view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employers\nWhilst manufacturing has declined, Glasgow's economy has seen significant relative growth of tertiary sector industries such as financial and business services (centred around the International Financial Services District on the Broomielaw, once a stretch of riverside warehouses replaced by modern office blocks), communications, biosciences, creative industries, healthcare, higher education, retail and tourism.[171] Glasgow is now the second most popular foreign tourist destination in Scotland (fifth in the UK)[172] and offers Scotland's largest retail centre.\nBetween 1998 and 2001, the city's financial services sector grew at a rate of 30%, making considerable gains on Edinburgh, which has historically been the centre of the Scottish financial sector.[173][174] Glasgow is now one of Europe's sixteen largest financial centres,[175] with a growing number of Blue chip financial sector companies establishing significant operations or headquarters in the city.[176]\nThe 1990s and first decade of the 21st century saw substantial growth in the number of call centres based in Glasgow. In 2007 roughly 20,000 people, a third of all call centre employees in Scotland, were employed by Glasgow call centres.[177] This growth and its high use of recruitment agencies to hire graduates as temporary workers has led to accusations of exploitative practices such as long hours, poor pay and lack of job security by the TUC and other union bodies.[178] In recent years some call centres have taken steps to rectify this criticism.[citation needed]\nThe city's main manufacturing industries include companies involved in; shipbuilding, engineering, construction, brewing and distilling, printing and publishing, chemicals and textiles as well as newer growth sectors such as optoelectronics, software development and biotechnology.[179] Glasgow forms the western part of the Silicon Glen high tech sector of Scotland with consumer electronics companies such as RHA Technologies headquartered.\n\nTransport[edit]\nSee also: transport in Glasgow\nPublic transport[edit]\n Glasgow Central station is the northern terminus of the West Coast Main Line.\nGlasgow has a large urban transport system, mostly managed by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT). \n\n Glasgow Queen Street station is the main connection for rail services to Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands.\nThe city has many bus services; since bus deregulation almost all are provided by private operators, though SPT part-funds some services. The principal bus operators within the city are: First Glasgow, McGill's Bus Services, Stagecoach West Scotland and Glasgow Citybus. The main bus terminal in the city is Buchanan bus station.\n\nGlasgow has the most extensive urban rail network in the UK outside London, with rail services travelling to a large part of the West of Scotland. Most lines were electrified under British Rail. All trains running within Scotland, including the local Glasgow trains, are operated by ScotRail, which is owned by the Scottish Government. Central station and Queen Street station are the two main railway terminals. Glasgow Central is the terminus of the 642\u00a0km (399\u00a0mi) long West Coast Main Line[180] from London Euston, as well as TransPennine Express services from Manchester and CrossCountry services from Birmingham, Bristol, Plymouth and various other destinations in England. Glasgow Central is also the terminus for suburban services on the south side of Glasgow, Ayrshire and Inverclyde, as well as being served by the cross city link from Dalmuir to Motherwell. Most other services within Scotland\u00a0\u2013 the main line to Edinburgh, plus services to Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and the Western Highlands\u00a0\u2013 operate from Queen Street station.  Buchanan Bus Station is the main bus terminal within Glasgow.\nThe city's suburban network is currently divided by the River Clyde and the Crossrail Glasgow initiative has been proposed to link them; it is currently awaiting funding from the Scottish Government. The city is linked to Edinburgh by four direct railway links. In addition to the suburban rail network, SPT operates the Glasgow Subway. The Subway is the United Kingdom's only completely underground metro system and is generally recognised as the world's third oldest underground railway after the London Underground and the Budapest Metro.[181] Both railway and subway stations have a number of park and ride facilities.\nAs part of the wider regeneration along the banks of the River Clyde, a bus rapid transit system called Clyde Fastlink is operational between Glasgow City Centre to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.[182]\n\n\nShipping[edit]\nGlobal-ship-management is carried out by maritime and logistics firms in Glasgow, in client companies employing over 100,000 seafarers. This reflects maritime skills over many decades and the training and education of deck officers and marine engineers from around the world at the City of Glasgow College, Nautical Campus, from which graduate around one third of all such graduates in the United Kingdom.[183]\nThe main operational dock within Glasgow operated by Clydeport is the King George V Dock, near Braehead. Since the advent of containerisation, most other facilities, such as Hunterston Terminal, are located in the deep waters of the Firth of Clyde, which together handle some 7.5\u00a0million tonnes of cargo each year. Longer distant commercial sea shipping from Glasgow occurs regularly to many European destinations, including Mediterranean and Baltic ports via passage through the Sea of the Hebrides.[184]\nLeisure and tourist sailing is important, at marinas and towns of the Clyde, including the PS Waverley, the world's last operational seagoing paddle-steamer.[185]\n\nRoads[edit]\n The M8, which crosses the Clyde over the Kingston Bridge, is Scotland's busiest motorway. The main M8 motorway passes around the city centre and connects with the M77, M74, M73 and M80 motorways, all of which pass within the city's boundaries. The A82 connects Glasgow to Argyll and the western Highlands. The M74 runs directly south towards Carlisle.\nOther strategic roads in the city include the East End Regeneration Route, which provides easier access to areas of the East End, linking the M8 to the extended M74.\n\nAirports[edit]\nThe city has three international airports within 45 minutes travel of the city centre, as well as a centrally located seaplane terminal. Two are dedicated to Glasgow while the third is Edinburgh International which, as it is situated on the west side of Edinburgh, is relatively close to Glasgow. These airports are Glasgow Airport (GLA) (eight\u00a0mi or thirteen\u00a0km west of the city centre) in Renfrewshire, Glasgow Prestwick Airport (PIK) (30\u00a0mi or 50\u00a0km southwest) in Ayrshire, Edinburgh Airport (EDI), (34\u00a0mi or 55\u00a0km east) in Edinburgh and Glasgow Seaplane Terminal, by the Glasgow Science Centre on the River Clyde. There are also several smaller, domestic and private airports around the city. There is a heliport, Glasgow City Heliport, located at Stobcross Quay on the banks of the Clyde.\nAll of the international airports are easily accessible by public transport, with GLA and EDI directly linked by a bus routes from the main bus station and a direct rail connection to PIK from Glasgow Central Station. A series of proposals to provide a direct rail link to Glasgow International Airport have ended unsuccessfully, beginning with the Glasgow Airport Rail Link in 2009.[186] As of 2019, local authorities have approved plans for a \"Glasgow Metro\", including a connection to the International Airport.[187]\n\nHousing[edit]\nMain article: Housing in Glasgow\n Typical red sandstone Glasgow terrace\nGlasgow is known for its tenements; the red and blond sandstone buildings are some of the most recognisable features of the city.[188] These were the most popular form of housing in 19th- and 20th-century Glasgow, and remain the most common form of dwelling in Glasgow today. Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, high ceilings and original period features.[189] The Hyndland area of Glasgow became the first tenement conservation area in the UK[190] and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.\nLike many cities in the UK, Glasgow witnessed the construction of high-rise housing in tower blocks in the 1960s, along with large overspill estates on the periphery of the city, in areas like Pollok, Nitshill, Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Milton and Drumchapel.[191] These were built to replace the decaying inner-city tenement buildings originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, to feed the local demand for labour.[192] The massive demand at that time outstripped the pace of new building, and many originally fine tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary.[193] Many degenerated into infamous slums, such as the Gorbals.\n\n 20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough Road\nEfforts to improve this housing situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust in the late 19th century, cleared the slums of the old town areas such as the Trongate, High Street and Glasgow Cross.[194] Subsequent urban renewal initiatives, such as those motivated by the Bruce Report, entailed the comprehensive demolition of slum tenement areas, the development of new towns on the periphery of the city, and the construction of tower blocks.\nThe policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful.[195] Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s[195] and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed many fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.[189] The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396\u00a0million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.[196]\n\nHealthcare[edit]\n Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the largest hospital campus in Europe.\nMedical care is mainly provided by NHS Scotland and is directly administered by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\nMajor hospitals, including those with Accident & Emergency provision, are: the Western Infirmary, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Dental Hospital in the city Centre, Stobhill Hospital in the North and the Victoria Infirmary and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in the South Side. Gartnavel Royal Hospital and The Priory are the two major psychiatric hospitals based in Glasgow.\nThe Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) Campus is a 1,677-bed acute hospital located in Govan in the south-west of Glasgow. The hospital is built on the site of the former Southern General Hospital and opened at the end of April 2015. The hospital comprises a newly built 1,109-bed adult hospital, a 256-bed children's hospital and two major A&E departments, one for adults and one for children in addition to buildings retained from the former hospital. The QEUH is the Regional Major Trauma Centre for the west of Scotland[197] and is also the largest hospital campus in Europe.[198]\nThere is also an emergency telephone service provided by NHS 24 and 24-hour access to general practitioners through out-of-hours centres. Paramedic services are provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service and supported by voluntary bodies like the St. Andrew's Ambulance Association. A strong teaching tradition is maintained between the city's main hospitals and the University of Glasgow Medical School.\nAll pharmacies provide a wide range of services including minor ailment advice, emergency hormonal contraception, public health advice, some provide oxygen and needle exchange.\nThere are private clinics and hospitals at the Nuffield in the west end and Ross Hall in the south side of the city.\nOn weekend evenings, when the statutory medical services are under most pressure, a charitable team of medical volunteers from Glasgow Street Aid patrol the city centre offering welfare and medical assistance, as well as onward medical referrals to those requiring it. This allows for minor ailments and injuries to be attended to, generally without the attendance of an emergency ambulance. The charity also responds to major medical emergencies upon request, where life support can be administered whilst further assistance from the ambulance service can be sought.[199]\n\nEducation[edit]\n The University of Glasgow is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and among the world's top 100 universities.\nGlasgow is a major centre of higher and academic research, with the following universities and colleges within 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) of the city centre:\n\nUniversity of Glasgow[200]\nUniversity of Strathclyde[201]\nGlasgow Caledonian University[202]\nUniversity of the West of Scotland[203]\nThe Glasgow School of Art[204]\nRoyal Conservatoire of Scotland[205]\nCity of Glasgow College[183]\nGlasgow Clyde College[206]\nGlasgow Kelvin College[207]\nWest College Scotland[208]\nIn 2011 Glasgow had 53,470 full-time students aged 18\u201374 resident in the city during term time, more than any other city in Scotland and the fifth-highest number in the United Kingdom outside London.[209] The majority of those who live away from home reside in Shawlands, Dennistoun and the West End of the city.[210]\nThe City Council operates 29 secondary schools, 149 primary schools and three specialist schools\u00a0\u2013 the Dance School of Scotland, Glasgow School of Sport and the Glasgow Gaelic School (Sgoil Gh\u00e0idhlig Ghlaschu), the only secondary school in Scotland to teach exclusively in Gaelic. Outdoor Education facilities are provided by the city council at the Blairvadach Centre, near Helensburgh. Jordanhill School is operated directly by the Scottish Government. Glasgow also has a number of Independent schools, including The High School of Glasgow, founded in 1124 and the oldest school in Scotland; Hutchesons' Grammar School, founded in 1639 and one of the oldest school institutions in Britain; and others such as Craigholme School (closed 2020), Glasgow Academy, Kelvinside Academy and St. Aloysius' College. Glasgow is part of the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities.[211]\n\nSport[edit]\nSee also: Sport in Glasgow\nFootball[edit]\nMain article: History of football in Scotland\n Glasgow is home to Hampden Park, home of the Scotland national football team.\nThe world's first international football match was held in 1872 at the West of Scotland Cricket Club's Hamilton Crescent ground in the Partick area of the city. The match, between Scotland and England finished 0\u20130.\nGlasgow was the first city (since joined by Liverpool in 1985, Madrid in 1986, 2014, 2016 and 2018, Milan in 1994 and London in 2019) to have had two football teams in European finals in the same season:[212] in 1967, Celtic competed in the European Cup final with rivals Rangers competing in the Cup Winners' Cup final. Rangers were the first football club from the United Kingdom to reach a European final, doing so in 1961. They have also won more domestic top-tier league titles than any other football club in the world (currently 55). Celtic were the first non-Latin club to win the European Cup, under the management of Jock Stein in 1967, before Manchester United the following year. Celtic also went on to reach another European Cup Final in 1970, losing to Feyenoord, and also the final of the UEFA Cup in 2003, where they lost an enthralling match which finished 3\u20132 to Portuguese club Porto. Rangers also reached the final of the same competition in 2008, where they lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg of Russia.\nHampden Park, which is Scotland's national football stadium, holds the European record for attendance at a football match: 149,547[213] saw Scotland beat England 3\u20131 in 1937, in the days before leading British stadia became all-seated. Hampden Park has hosted the final of the UEFA Champions League on three occasions, most recently in 2002 and hosted the UEFA Cup Final in 2007. Celtic Park (60,411 seats) is located in the east end of Glasgow, and Ibrox Stadium (50,817 seats) on the south side.\nGlasgow has four professional football clubs, who all play in the SPFL: Celtic, Rangers, Partick Thistle, and Queen's Park (after their move from amateur status in November 2019). Prior to this, Glasgow had two other professional teams: Clyde (since moved to Cumbernauld) and Third Lanark (liquidated in 1967), plus four others active in the league in the 19th century: Thistle, Cowlairs, Northern and Linthouse. There are a number of West of Scotland Football League clubs within the city as well, such as Pollok, Maryhill, Benburb, Ashfield, Glasgow Perthshire F.C., Glasgow United (formerly Shettleston Juniors), and Petershill, plus numerous amateur teams.\nThe history of football in the city, as well as the status of the Old Firm, attracts many visitors to football matches in the city throughout the season. The Scottish Football Association, the national governing body, and the Scottish Football Museum are based in Glasgow, as are the Scottish Professional Football League, Scottish Junior Football Association and Scottish Amateur Football Association. The Glasgow Cup was a once popular tournament, which was competed for by Rangers, Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle and Queen's Park. The competition is now played for by the youth sides of the five teams.\nGlasgow is also home to six women's football teams. Currently, Glasgow City are the champions of the Scottish Women's Premier League.[214] Other local teams include Glasgow Girls and the women's sections of the men's clubs: Celtic and Rangers play in the top division.\n\n\n\nClub\n\nFounded\n\nLeague\n\nVenue\n\nCapacity\n\n\nCeltic F.C.\n\n1888\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nCeltic Park\n\n60,411[215]\n\n\nRangers F.C.\n\n1872\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nIbrox Stadium\n\n50,817[216]\n\n\nPartick Thistle F.C.\n\n1876\n\nScottish Championship\n\nFirhill Stadium\n\n10,102[217]\n\n\nQueen's Park F.C.\n\n1867\n\nScottish Championship\n\nFirhill Stadium\n\n10,102[218]\n\nRugby union[edit]\nGlasgow has a professional rugby union club, the Glasgow Warriors, which plays in the European Rugby Champions Cup and Pro14 alongside teams from Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Italy and South Africa. The Warriors current home is Scotstoun Stadium and has been since 2012, previously they played at Firhill Stadium. They have won the Melrose 7s in both 2014 and 2015 and were also crowned champions of the Pro12 at the end of the 2014/15 season after beating Irish side Munster in Belfast.\nIn the Scottish League, Glasgow Hawks RFC was formed in 1997 by the merger of two of Glasgow's oldest clubs: Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow High Kelvinside (GHK). Despite the merger, the second division teams of Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow High Kelvinside re-entered the Scottish rugby league in 1998.\nSouth of Glasgow, in East Renfrewshire, in the suburb of Giffnock, is based another of Glasgow area's most prominent clubs Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC (GHA). GHA was formed in 2002 with the merger of two of Glasgow's leading clubs at the time, Glasgow Southern RFC and Hutchesons Aloysians RFC.\nCartha Queen's Park play at Dumbreck, within the city.\nGlasgow was also home to one of the oldest rugby clubs in Scotland,[219] West of Scotland F.C., which was formed in 1865, and was a founding member of the Scottish Rugby Union. The club was originally based in Partick at Hamilton Crescent but is now based outside the city, at Burnbrae, Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire.\n\nRugby league[edit]\nThe Easterhouse Panthers based in the East End of Glasgow are a rugby league team who play in the Rugby League Conference Scotland Division. Scotstoun Stadium has also hosted many rugby league tournaments/events.\n\nIce hockey[edit]\nThe City of Glasgow has a number of ice rinks, and a temporary one is set up in George Square in the Christmas period.\nFrom 1966 to 1986, the Glasgow Dynamos played at Crossmyloof Ice Rink.[220] Since October 2010 a team called the Glasgow Clan based in the nearby Braehead Arena in Renfrewshire has played in the professional Elite Ice Hockey League alongside two other Scottish teams, the Fife Flyers and the Dundee Stars. This is the first time that a top level ice hockey team has represented Glasgow.\n\nSwimming[edit]\nThe Arlington Baths Club was founded in 1870. It is situated in the Woodlands area of the city and is still in use today. It is believed the club's first Baths Master William Wilson invented water polo at the club. The Arlington inspired other Swimming Clubs and the Western Baths, which opened in 1876, is also still in existence in nearby Hillhead. Most of Glasgow's Victorian and Edwardian Municipal Pools have been closed or demolished, with the city council investing in large new leisure centres such as Tollcross, Springburn, Gorbals, Scotstoun and Bellahouston. A community group is however hoping to re-open Govanhill Baths, on the city's southside.\n\nBasketball[edit]\nGlasgow hosts Scotland's only professional basketball team, the Glasgow Rocks, who compete in the British Basketball League. Previously based in Renfrewshire's Braehead Arena and the 1,200-seat Kelvin Hall, the team has been based at the Emirates Arena since the 2012/13 season.\n\nOther sports[edit]\n Emirates Arena in Glasgow, one of the designated stadiums constructed for the 2014 Commonwealth Games\nMajor international sporting arenas include the Kelvin Hall and Scotstoun Sports Centre. In 2003 the National Academy for Badminton was completed in Scotstoun. In 2003, Glasgow was also given the title of European Capital of Sport.[221]\nGlasgow is also host to many cricket clubs including Clydesdale Cricket Club who have been title winners for the Scottish Cup many times. This club also acted as a neutral venue for a One Day International match between India and Pakistan in 2007, but due to bad weather it was called off.\nSmaller sporting facilities include an abundance of outdoor playing fields, as well as golf clubs such as Haggs Castle and artificial ski slopes. Between 1998 and 2004, the Scottish Claymores American football team played some or all of their home games each season at Hampden Park and the venue also hosted World Bowl XI.\nGlasgow Green and the Gorbals are home to a number of rowing clubs, some with open membership the rest belonging to universities or schools. Historically, rowing races on the River Clyde here attracted huge crowds of spectators to watch regattas in the late 19th century and early 20th century;[222] before football caught the public imagination. Two of Glasgow's rowing clubs separately claim that it was their members who were among the founders of Rangers Football Club.[223]\nMotorcycle speedway racing was first introduced to Glasgow in 1928 and is currently staged at Ashfield Stadium in the North of the city. The home club, Glasgow Tigers, compete in the SGB Championship, the second tier of motorcycle speedway in Britain.\nGlasgow is also one of five places in Scotland that hosts the final of the Scottish Cup of Shinty, better known as the Camanachd Cup. This is usually held at Old Anniesland. Once home to numerous Shinty clubs, there is now only one senior club in Glasgow, Glasgow Mid-Argyll, as well as two university sides from University of Strathclyde and University of Glasgow.\nGlasgow bid to host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics but lost to Buenos Aires in the 4 July 2013 vote.[224]\nGlasgow was the host of the 2018 European Sports Championships along with Berlin (hosts of the 2018 European Athletics Championships).\n\n2014 Commonwealth Games[edit]\nSee also: 2014 Commonwealth Games\nOn 9 November 2007, Glasgow was selected to be the host city of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The games were held at a number of existing and newly constructed sporting venues across the city, including a refurbished Hampden Park, Kelvingrove Park, Kelvin Hall, and the OVO Hydro at the SECC. The opening ceremony was held at Celtic Park. 2014 was the third time the Games have been held in Scotland.[225][226]\n\nMajor incidents and tragedies[edit]\n The aftermath of the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack, the first terrorist attack to take place in Scotland since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988\n5 April 1902 \u2013 1902 Ibrox disaster \u2013 25 spectators died and more than 500 were injured when a new wooden stand at the Ibrox Park stadium collapsed during an England\u2013Scotland match.[227]\n1960s/1970s \u2013 Many perished at three major blazes: the Cheapside Street whisky bond fire in Cheapside Street, Anderston (1960, 19 killed);[228] the James Watt Street fire (1968, 22 killed);[229] and the Kilbirnie Street fire (1972, seven killed).[230]\n2 January 1971 \u2013 1971 Ibrox disaster \u2013 66 people were killed in a crush, as supporters attempted to vacate the stadium.\n11 May 2004 \u2013 Stockline Plastics factory explosion \u2013 The ICL Plastics factory (commonly referred to as Stockline Plastics factory), in the Woodside district of Glasgow, exploded. Nine people were killed, including two company directors, and 33 injured \u2013 15 seriously. The four-storey building was largely destroyed.\n30 June 2007 \u2013 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack \u2013 Two jihadist terrorists\u2014Bilal Abdullah and Kafeel Ahmed\u2014deliberately drove a Jeep Cherokee SUV loaded with propane cylinders into the glass doors of a crowded terminal at Glasgow International Airport in an attempted suicide attack. A concrete security pillar blocked the car from entering the terminal. The two perpetrators were both apprehended; Ahmed died of burn wounds sustained in the attack, while Abdullah was convicted in Woolwich Crown Court of conspiracy to murder through terrorism and was sentenced to at least 32 years' imprisonment.[231][232] The perpetrators were also linked to a failed car bombing in London the previous day. Ahmed's brother Sabeel Ahmed pleaded guilty to failing to disclose information about an act of terrorism and was deported.[232]\n29 November 2013 \u2013 2013 Glasgow helicopter crash \u2013 A Eurocopter EC135-T2+ police helicopter (operated by Bond Air Services for Police Scotland) crashed on top of The Clutha Vaults Bar in Glasgow City Centre, killing all aboard the helicopter (the pilot and two crew members) and seven people in the pub. The cause of the crash was fuel starvation due to pilot error.[233][234]\n23 May 2014 \u2013 Glasgow School of Art blaze \u2013 A fire tore through the historic and world-renowned Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh building, that was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Around a tenth of the structure and 30% of its contents were destroyed, including the prized Mackintosh Library. There were no deaths but a few were treated for minor smoke inhalation. The Scottish Fire and Rescue were praised for their quick response and plan to effectively tackle the fire. It was later found after a fire investigation that gases inside a projector had overheated and ignited.\n22 December 2014 \u2013 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash \u2013 Six people were killed and many were seriously injured when a bin lorry careened out of control and collided with pedestrians, vehicles, and buildings, on Queen Street, Glasgow, before crashing into the Millennium Hotel. The subsequent fatal accident inquiry established that the driver had suffered a \"neurocardiogenic syncope\" (fainting) episode that caused him to lose control of his vehicle.[235][236]\n29 December 2014 \u2013 first Ebola virus case in Scotland \u2013 Pauline Cafferkey, a nurse returning to Glasgow from Kerry Town treatment centre, Sierra Leone, West Africa where she had been a volunteer caring for patients infected with the Ebola virus was taken into isolation after testing positive for the virus. She was not diagnosed before leaving Sierra Leone.\n15 June 2018 \u2013 A fire once again broke out in the partially restored Glasgow School of Art, causing extensive damage. The School was widely criticised for failing to install an effective modern sprinkler system in a timely manner. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19 pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire. No casualties were reported. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown.\nNamesake area on Mars[edit]\nThere is an area on Planet Mars which NASA has named Glasgow, after Scotland's largest city.

fourth-most populous city in the United Kingdom, as well as being the 27th largest city by population in Europe.[7] In 2020, it had an estimated population of 635,640. Straddling the border between historic Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, the city now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and is governed by Glasgow City Council. It is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands.\nGlasgow/\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a, \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a//\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a, \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a//\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a, \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a/\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a\u02c8\u0261l\u0251\u02d0z\u0261o\u028a \u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028a\u02c8\u0261l\u00e6z\u0261o\u028aGLAHZ-goh, GLAZ-gohGLAHZ-goh, GLAZ-gohGLAHZGLAZScotsGlesca or GlesgaScottish GaelicGlaschumost populouscityScotlandfourth-most populous cityUnited KingdomEurope[7][7]historicLanarkshireRenfrewshirecouncil areas of ScotlandGlasgow City CouncilRiver ClydeWest Central LowlandsGlasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the \"Second City of the British Empire\" for much of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.[8][9][10][11]\nmedievalbishopricroyal burghUniversity of GlasgowScottish EnlightenmentNorth AmericaWest IndiesIndustrial Revolutionshipbuildingmarine engineeringBritish EmpireVictorianEdwardian eras[8][8][9][9][10][10][11][11]In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938.[12] The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. Over 985,200 people live in the Greater Glasgow contiguous urban area, while the wider Glasgow City Region is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population.[3] The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2. Natives or inhabitants are known as Glaswegians, and are well known for their distinctive dialect and accent.\n[12][12]urban renewalnew townsCumbernauldLivingstonEast KilbrideGreater GlasgowGlasgow City Region[3][3]locality2dialect and accentGlasgow has the largest economy in Scotland and the third-highest GDP per capita of any city in the UK.[13][14] Glasgow's major cultural institutions \u2013 the Burrell Collection, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Ballet and Scottish Opera \u2013 enjoy international reputations. The city was the European Capital of Culture in 1990 and is notable for its architecture, culture, media, music scene, sports clubs and transport connections. It is the fifth-most visited city in the United Kingdom.[15] The city hosted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at its main events venue, the SEC Centre. Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the first European Championships in 2018, and was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020. The city is also well known in the sporting world for football, particularly the Old Firm rivalry between Celtic and Rangers.\neconomy in Scotland[13][13][14][14]Burrell CollectionKelvingrove Art

The first element glas, meaning \"grey-green, grey-blue\" both in Brittonic and modern day Welsh and the second *c\u00f6\u00fc, \"hollow\" (c.f. Welsh glas-cau),[16] giving a meaning of \"green-hollow\".[17]  The green-hollow may refer to the ravine to the east of Glasgow Cathedral. It is often said that the name means \"dear green place\" or that \"dear green place\" is a translation from Gaelic Glas Caomh.[18]  \"The dear green place\" remains an affectionate way of referring to the city. The modern Gaelic is Glaschu and derived from the same roots as the English.\nBrittonicglasBrittonicWelsh*c\u00f6\u00fcWelshglas-cau[16][16][17][17]Glas Caomh[18][18]GlaschuThe settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name, Cathures; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as Glasgu. It is also recorded that the King of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the Molendinar Burn where Glasgow Cathedral now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as Glasgu.\nCathuresGlasguKing of StrathclydeRhydderch HaelMolendinar BurnGlasgow CathedralGlasguHistory[edit]History[edit][edit]Main article: History of GlasgowHistory of GlasgowFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Glasgow history.Timeline of Glasgow historyOrigins and development[edit]Origins and development[edit][edit]The area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the River Clyde providing a natural location for fishing. The Romans later built outposts in the area and, to protect Roman Britannia from the Brittonic speaking (Celtic) Caledonians, constructed the Antonine Wall. Items from the wall, such as altars from Roman forts like Balmuildy, can be found at the Hunterian Museum today.\nRiver ClydeRomansBritanniaBrittonic speakingCelticCaledoniansAntonine WallRoman fortsBalmuildyHunterian MuseumGlasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian missionary Saint Mungo in the 6th century. He established a church on the Molendinar Burn, where the present Glasgow Cathedral stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.\nGlasgow grew over the following centuries. The Glasgow Fair reportedly began in 1190.[19] The first bridge over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285, giving its name to the Briggait area of the city, forming the main north\u2013south route over the river via Glasgow Cross. The founding of the University of Glasgow in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to become the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.[20]\nmissionarySaint MungoMolendinar BurnGlasgow CathedralGlasgow Fair[19][19]first bridgeGlasgow CrossUniversity of GlasgowbishopricArchdiocese of Glasgow[20][20]Following the European Protestant Reformation and with the encouragement of the Convention of Royal Burghs, the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year.[20] Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of Royal Burgh in 1611.[21] Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the Atlantic triangular slave trade.[22][23]\nReformationConvention of Royal Burghs[20][20]Royal Burgh[21][21]Atlantic triangular slave trade[22][22][23][23]Daniel Defoe visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, that Glasgow was \"the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted\". At that time the city's population was about 12,000, and the city was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to its economy and urban fabric, brought about by the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.\nDaniel DefoeA tour thro' the whole island of Great BritainA tour thro' the whole island of Great BritainScottish EnlightenmentTrading port[edit]Trading port[edit][edit]After the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. Starting in 1668, the city's Tobacco Lords created a deep water port at Port Glasgow about 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) down the River Clyde, as the river from the city to that point was then too shallow for seagoing merchant ships.[24] By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on the River Clyde, with over 47,000,000\u00a0lb (21,000\u00a0t) of tobacco being imported each year at its peak.[25] At the time, Glasgow held a commercial importance as the city participated in the trade of sugar, tobacco and later cotton.[26]\nActs of UnionTobacco LordsPort GlasgowRiver Clyde[24][24][25][25][26][26]Industrialisation[edit]Industrialisation[edit][edit] Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881 Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881Shipping on the Clyde, Atkinson Grimshaw, 1881Shipping on the ClydeAtkinson GrimshawThe opening of the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire. After extensive river engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow. The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, John Knox, James Kay, Sir Muirhead Bone, Robert Eadie and L.S. Lowry, willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world, as did Stanley Spencer downriver at Port Glasgow.\nMonkland CanalForth and Clyde CanalPort DundasLanarkshireriver engineeringRobert NapierJohn ElderGeorge ThomsonSir William PearceSir Alfred YarrowJohn Atkinson GrimshawJohn KnoxJames KaySir Muirhead BoneRobert EadieL.S.

The development of civic institutions included the City of Glasgow Police in 1800, one of the first municipal police forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the City of Glasgow Bank's collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the \"Second City of the Empire\" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping[27] and a quarter of all locomotives in the world.[28] In addition to its pre-eminence in shipbuilding, engineering, industrial machinery, bridge building, chemicals, explosives, coal and oil industries it developed as a major centre in textiles, garment-making, carpet manufacturing, leather processing, furniture-making, pottery, food, drink and cigarette making; printing and publishing. Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.[20]\nCity of Glasgow PolicepoliceCity of Glasgow Bank[27][27][28][28][20][20]Glasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the Lowlands and the Highlands of Scotland, from Ireland and other parts of Britain and from Continental Europe.[20] During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the Milngavie water treatment works, Glasgow Subway, Glasgow Corporation Tramways, City Chambers, Mitchell Library and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of International Exhibitions at Kelvingrove Park, in 1888, 1901 and 1911, with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the Empire Exhibition, being subsequently held in 1938 at Bellahouston Park, which drew 13 million visitors.[29]\nLowlandsHighlands of ScotlandIrelandContinental Europe[20][20]Milngavie water treatment worksGlasgow SubwayGlasgow Corporation TramwaysCity ChambersMitchell LibraryKelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumInternational ExhibitionsKelvingrove Park188819011911Empire ExhibitionBellahouston Park[29][29]The 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After World War I, the city suffered from the impact of the Post\u2013World War I recession and from the later Great Depression, this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the \"Red Clydeside\" movement. The city had recovered by the outbreak of World War II. The city saw aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe[30] during the Clydebank Blitz, during the war, then grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950s. By the 1960s, growth of industry in countries like Japan and West Germany, weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries. As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, urban decay, population decline, welfare dependency and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial Bruce Report, which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city. The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts that started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s. This involved the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.[31]\nWorld War IPost\u2013World War I recessionGreat DepressionRed ClydesideWorld War IIaerial bombardmentLuftwaffe[30][30]Clydebank BlitzWest Germanywelfare dependencyBruce ReportBruce Report[31][31] Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943) Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943)Sauchiehall Street during World War II (1943)Sauchiehall StreetWorld War IIThe city invested heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and East Kilbride, dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands to halve the city's population base.[31] By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The \"Glasgow's miles better\" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment.[32] The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, its status as European Capital of Culture in 1990,[33] and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy.[34] However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler.[35] Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas, including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration, has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of gentrification.[36] In 2008, the city was listed by Lonely Planet as one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.[37]\nScottish OfficeSilicon Glennew townsEast KilbrideScottish Lowlands[31][31]Glasgow's miles betterBurrell CollectionScottish Exhibition and Conference Centre[32][32]Glasgow Garden FestivalEuropean Capital of Culture[33][33][34][34][35][35]regenerationClyde Waterfront Regenerationgentrification[36][36]Lonely Planet[37][37]Despite Glasgow's economic renaissance, the East End of the city remains the focus of social deprivation.[38] A Glasgow Economic Audit report published in 2007 stated that the gap between prosperous and deprived areas of the city is widening.[39] In 2006, 47% of Glasgow's population lived in the most deprived 15% of areas in Scotland,[39] while the Centre for Social Justice reported 29.4% of the city's working-age residents to be \"economically inactive\".[38] Although marginally behind the UK average, Glasgow still has a higher employment rate than Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.[39] In 2008 the city was ranked at 43 for Personal Safety in the Mercer index of top 50 safest cities in the world.[40] The Mercer report was specifically looking at Quality of Living, yet by 2011 within Glasgow, certain areas were (still) \"failing to meet the Scottish Air Quality Objective levels for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10)\".[41]\nEast End[38][38][39][39][39][39]Centre for Social Justice[38][38][39][39]Mercer[40][40][41][41]Sanitation[edit]Sanitation[edit][edit]With the population growing, the first scheme to provide a public water supply was by the Glasgow Company in 1806. A second company was formed in 1812, and the two merged in 1838, but there was some dissatisfaction with the quality of the water supplied.[42] The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company began supplying water to residents living to the south of the River Clyde in 1846, obtained from reservoirs, which gave 75,000 people a constant water supply,[42] but others were not so fortunate, and some 4,000 died in an outbreak of cholera in 1848/1849.[43] This led to the development of the Glasgow Corporation Water Works, with a project to raise the level of Loch Katrine and to convey clean water by gravity along a 26\u00a0mi (42\u00a0km) aqueduct to a holding reservoir at Milngavie, and then by pipes into the city.[44] The project cost \u00a3980,000[43] and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859.[45]\n[42][42][42][42]cholera[43][43]Glasgow Corporation Water WorksLoch Katrine[44][44][43][43]Queen Victoria[45][45]The engineer for the project was John Frederick Bateman, while James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project, and subsequently became Engineer in Chief for Glasgow Water Commissioners. He oversaw several improvements during his tenure, including a second aqueduct and further raising of water levels in Loch Katrine.[46] Additional supplies were provided by Loch Arklet in 1902, by impounding the water and creating a tunnel to allow water to flow into Loch Katrine. A similar scheme to create a reservoir in Glen Finglas was authorised in 1903, but was deferred, and was not completed until 1965.[43] Following the 2002 Glasgow floods, the waterborne parasite cryptosporidium was found in the reservoir at Milngavie, and so the new Milngavie water treatment works was built. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth in 2007, and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for \u00a310 million below its budgeted cost.[47]\nJohn Frederick Bateman[46][46]Glen Finglas[43][43]2002 Glasgow floodscryptosporidiumMilngavie water treatment worksQueen Elizabeth[47][47]Good health requires both clean water and effective removal of sewage. The Caledonian Railway rebuilt many of the sewers, as part of a deal to allow them to tunnel under the city, and sewage treatment works were opened at Dalmarnoch in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. The works experimented to find better ways to treat sewage, and a number of experimental filters were constructed, until a full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 at a cost of \u00a34 million.[48] Treated sludge was dumped at sea, and Glasgow Corporation owned six sludge ships between 1904 and 1998,[49] when the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive ended the practice.[50] The sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel 3.1\u00a0mi (5.0\u00a0km) long, which provides 20\u00d710^6\u00a0imp\u00a0gal (90\u00a0Ml) of storm water storage. It will reduce the risk of flooding and the likelihood that sewage will overflow into the Clyde during storms.[51] Since 2002, clean water provision and sewerage have been the responsibility of Scottish Water.[52]\nCaledonian Railway[48][48][49][49]Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive[50][50]\u00d71010^6[51][51]Scottish Water[52][52]Heraldry[edit]Heraldry[edit][edit]The coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866CrestSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.The coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866CrestSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.The coat of arms of the City of GlasgowThe coat of arms of the City of GlasgowAdopted1866Adopted1866CrestSaint MungoCrestCrestSaint MungoSaint MungoSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsSupportersSupportersTwo salmon, bearing ringsMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.MottoMottoLet Glasgow Flourish by the preaching of Your word, and the praising of Your name.The coat of arms of the City of Glasgow was granted to the royal burgh by the Lord Lyon on 25 October 1866.[53] It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date.

This was abbreviated to \"Let Glasgow Flourish\" and adopted as the city's motto.\nLord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy nameIn 1450, John Stewart, the first Lord Provost of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a \"St Mungo's Bell\" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the People's Palace Museum, near Glasgow Green.\nLord ProvostPeople's PalaceGlasgow GreenThe supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in \"the act of benediction\". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold mural crown between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.\nbenedictionmural crownThe arms were re-matriculated by the City of Glasgow District Council on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996.

The city council was controlled by the Labour Party for over thirty years, since the decline of the Progressives. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the single transferable vote rather than the first-past-the-post system, the dominance of the Labour Party within the city started to decline.

During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the Independent Labour Party. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the poll tax; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the Scottish Socialist Party, another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a Conservative MP since the 1982 Hillhead by-election, when the SDP took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the Progressives) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour Lord Provost.\nIndustrial actionRed ClydesideIndependent Labour Partypoll taxScottish Socialist PartyConservative1982 Hillhead by-electionSDP2012ProgressivesLord ProvostGlasgow is represented in both the House of Commons in London, and the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh.

All are located to the west of the city, in neighbouring Renfrewshire.\nOwing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Winter temperatures are usually higher than in most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to continental Western Europe. At Paisley, the annual precipitation averages 1,245\u00a0mm (49.0\u00a0in). Glasgow has been named as the rainiest city of the UK, having an average of 170 days of rain a year.[64][65]\nMoscowoceanicK\u00f6ppenCfbGulf StreamPaisley[64][64][65][65]Winters are cool and overcast, with a January mean of 5.0\u00a0\u00b0C (41.0\u00a0\u00b0F), though lows sometimes fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C (10\u00a0\u00b0F) in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours.\nDuring the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F), and very rarely exceed 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.\nThe official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe. The warmest month on record in the data series is July 2006, with an average high of 22.7\u00a0\u00b0C (72.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and low of 13.7\u00a0\u00b0C (56.7\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] Even this extreme event only matched a normal summer on similar parallels in continental Europe, underlining the maritime influences. The coldest month on record since the data series began is December 2010, during a severe cold wave affecting the British Isles. Even then, the December high was above freezing at 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C (34.9\u00a0\u00b0F) with the low of \u22124.4\u00a0\u00b0C (24.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[66] This still ensured Glasgow's coldest month of 2010 remained milder than the isotherm of \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F) normally used to determine continental climate normals.\n[66][66]cold wave[66][66]Temperature extremes have ranged from

peaked at 1,089,000. Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the Gorbals and relocation to \"new towns\" such as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld led to population decline.

In the 1881 UK Census, 83% of the population was born in Scotland, 13% in Ireland, 3% in England and 1% elsewhere. By 1911, the city was no longer gaining population by migration. The demographic percentages in the 1951 UK census were: born in Scotland 93%, Ireland 3%, England 3% and elsewhere 1%.[20] In the early twentieth century, many Lithuanian refugees began to settle in Glasgow and at its height in the 1950s; there were around 10,000 in the Glasgow area.[76] Many Italian Scots also settled in Glasgow, originating from provinces like Frosinone in Lazio and Lucca in north-west Tuscany at this time, many originally working as \"Hokey Pokey\" men.[77]\nIrelandDonegalFermanaghTyroneLondonderry[20][20]Lithuanian[76][76]Italian ScotsFrosinoneLazioLuccaTuscanyHokey Pokey[77][77]\n\n\nHistorical population of Glasgow and city limits\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population and city limits\n\n\nYear[78]\n\nPopulation\n\nArea  (km2)\n\nDensity  (inhabitants/km2)\n\nArea changes\n\n\n1300\n1,500\n-[79]\n\u2013\nInitial\n\n\n1600\n7,000\n\u2013\n\u2013\nUnknown\n\n\n1791\n66,000\n7.16\n9,217\nAnderson to James Street/West Nile Street to Camlachie\n\n\n1831\n202,426\n8.83\n22,924\nNecropolis and Blythswood\n\n\n1846\n280,000\n23.44\n11,945\nBurghs of Anderston and Calton/Barony of Gorbals\n\n\n1872\n494,824\n24.42\n20,263\nDistricts of Keppochhill, Alexandra Parade and the new Glasgow University grounds\n\n\n1891\n658,073\n48.00\n13,709\nBurghs of Govanhill, Crosshill, Pollokshields, Maryhill and Hillhead.

This had started as a residential district of the wealthy city merchants involved in international trade and the textile industries in the 18th and early 19th centuries, with their warehouses nearby, including the Tobacco Lords from whom many of the streets take their name. With its mercantile wealth, and continuing growth even before the Industrial Revolution, the city expanded by creating the New Town around George Square, soon followed by the New Town of Blythswood on Blythswood Hill which includes Blythswood Square.[99] The original medieval centre around Glasgow Cross and the High Street was left behind.\nMerchant CityTobacco LordsIndustrial RevolutionGeorge SquareBlythswood HillBlythswood Square[99][99]Glasgow Cross, situated at the junction of High Street, leading up to Glasgow Cathedral, Gallowgate, Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its Mercat cross. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Steeple, all that remains of the original Glasgow Tolbooth, which was demolished in 1921. Moving northward up High Street towards Rottenrow and Townhead lies the 15th century Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand's Lordship. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.[100]\nHigh StreetGlasgow CathedralTrongateMercat crossGlasgow TolboothRottenrowTownheadGlasgow CathedralProvand's Lordship[100][100]From the 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre flats and warehouse conversions.

The area has supported a growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces.[103] The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a \"cultural quarter\" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and Glasgow City Council,[103] and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both.[104] The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the Tron Theatre, the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the City Halls.[105]\nTrongateMerchant City Festival[103][103]Glasgow City Council[103][103][104][104]Tron TheatreCity Halls[105][105]International Financial Services District[edit]International Financial Services District[edit][edit]Further information: International Financial Services DistrictInternational Financial Services District The International Financial Services District alongside the River Clyde The International Financial Services District alongside the River ClydeThe International Financial Services District alongside the River ClydeInternational Financial Services DistrictTo the western edge of the city centre, occupying the areas of Blythswood Hill and Anderston, lies Glasgow's financial district, known officially as the International Financial Services District (IFSD), although often irreverently nicknamed by the contemporary press as the \"square kilometre\" or \"Wall Street on Clyde\".[106] Since the late 1980s the construction of many modern office blocks and high rise developments have paved the way for the IFSD to become one of the UK's largest financial quarters.

Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by David Dale, whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern Gillespie, Kidd & Coia building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as \"Homes for the Future\", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.[113]\nGlasgow Necropoliscathedral[112][112]John KnoxDavid DaleNational Trust for ScotlandGillespie, Kidd & Coia[113][113]East of Glasgow Cross is St Andrew's in the Square, the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739\u20131757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy tobacco merchants.

The adjoining urban area includes some of Greater Glasgow's most affluent suburban towns, such as Newton Mearns, Clarkston, and Giffnock, all of which are in East Renfrewshire, as well as Thorntonhall in South Lanarkshire. Newlands and Dumbreck are examples of high-value residential districts within the city boundaries. There are many areas containing a high concentration of sandstone tenements, examples being Battlefield, Govanhill, Mount Florida and Shawlands. The large suburb of Pollokshields comprises both a quiet western part with undulating tree-lined boulevards lined with expensive villas, and a busier eastern part with a high-density grid of tenements and small shops. The south side also includes some post-war housing estates of various sizes such as Toryglen, Pollok, Castlemilk and Arden. The towns of Cambuslang and Rutherglen were included in the City of Glasgow district from 1975 to 1996, but are now in the South Lanarkshire council area.[119][120][121]\nNewton MearnsClarkstonGiffnockEast RenfrewshireThorntonhallSouth LanarkshireNewlandsDumbreckBattlefieldGovanhillMount FloridaShawlandsPollokshieldsToryglenPollokCastlemilkArdenCambuslangRutherglenSouth Lanarkshire[119][119][120][120][121][121]Although predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Scotland Street School Museum and House for an Art Lover; the Burrell Collection in Pollok Country Park; Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson's Holmwood House villa; the National Football Stadium Hampden Park in Mount Florida (home of Queens Park FC) and Ibrox Stadium (home of Rangers FC).\nCharles Rennie MackintoshScotland Street School MuseumHouse for an Art LoverBurrell CollectionPollok Country ParkAlexander \"Greek\" ThomsonHolmwood HouseHampden ParkMount FloridaQueens Park FCIbrox StadiumRangers FCThe former docklands site at Pacific Quay on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the Glasgow Science Centre and the headquarters of BBC Scotland and STV Group (owner of STV), in a new purpose built digital media campus.\nPacific QuayGlasgow Science CentreBBC ScotlandSTV GroupSTVIn addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built, including the Clyde Arc known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at Pacific Quay and others at Tradeston and Springfield Quay.\nClyde ArcPacific QuayTradestonThe South Side also includes many public parks, including Linn Park, Queen's Park, and Bellahouston Park and several golf clubs, including the championship course at Haggs Castle.

It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is home to one of two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system.

Also in the 15th century began the building of Cathcart Castle, completed c. 1450 with an impressive view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle Mary Queen of Scots supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the Battle of Langside in May 1568. The castle was demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the central city area as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has an impressive heritage of Victorian architecture: the Glasgow City Chambers; the main building of the University of Glasgow, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott; and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, designed by Sir John W. Simpson, are notable examples.\nmedievalProvand's LordshipSt. Mungo's CathedralCathcart CastleMary Queen of ScotsBattle of LangsideVictorian architectureGlasgow City ChambersUniversity of GlasgowSir George Gilbert ScottKelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumSir John W.

A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the Queen's Cross Church, the only church by the renowned artist to be built.[160]\nGlasgow SchoolCharles Rennie MackintoshArts and Crafts MovementArt NouveauGlasgow School of ArtWillow TearoomsScotland Street School MuseumQueen's Cross Church[160][160]Another architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance is Alexander Thomson, with notable examples including the Holmwood House villa, and likewise Sir John James Burnet, awarded the R.I.B.A.'s Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the \"Second City of the Empire\". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The shipyards, marine engineering, steel making, and heavy industry all contributed to the growth of the city.\nAlexander ThomsonHolmwood HouseJohn James Burnetshipyardsmarine engineeringheavy industryMany of the city's most impressive buildings were built with red or blond sandstone, but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the furnaces, until the Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956. In recent years many of these buildings have been cleaned and restored to their original appearance.[citation needed] There are over 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over 1,471 hectares (3,630 acres). Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields \u2013 the first major planned garden suburb in Britain \u2013 Newlands and the village of Carmunnock.[161]\nsandstonefurnacesClean Air Act[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation needed[161][161]Modern buildings in Glasgow include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and along the banks of the Clyde are the Glasgow Science Centre, The OVO Hydro and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, whose Clyde Auditorium was designed by Sir Norman Foster, and is colloquially known as the \"Armadillo\". In 2006 Zaha Hadid won a competition to design the new Museum of Transport.[162] Hadid's museum opened on the waterfront in 2011 and has been renamed the Riverside Museum to reflect the change in location and to celebrate Glasgow's rich industrial heritage stemming from the Clyde.[163]\nGlasgow Royal Concert HallGlasgow Science CentreThe OVO HydroScottish Exhibition and Conference CentreClyde AuditoriumSir Norman FosterArmadilloZaha HadidMuseum of Transport[162][162]Riverside Museum[163][163]Glasgow's impressive historical and modern architectural traditions were celebrated in 1999 when the city was designated UK City of Architecture and Design,[164] winning the accolade over Liverpool and Edinburgh.[165]\n[164][164]LiverpoolEdinburgh[165][165]Economy[edit]Economy[edit][edit] RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, better known as the QE2, was built in Glasgow at the John Brown Shipyard on the River Clyde.

Glasgow also has the third highest GDP Per capita of any city in the UK (after London and Edinburgh).[14][needs update] The city itself sustains more than 410,000 jobs in over 12,000 companies. Over 153,000 jobs were created in the city between 2000 and 2005\u00a0\u2013 a growth rate of 32%.[166] Glasgow's annual economic growth rate of 4.4% is now second only to that of London.

Once dominant export orientated manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding and other heavy engineering have been gradually replaced in importance by more diversified forms of economic activity, although major manufacturing firms continue to be headquartered in the city, such as Aggreko, Weir Group, Clyde Blowers, Howden, Linn Products, Firebrand Games, William Grant & Sons, Whyte and Mackay, The Edrington Group, British Polar Engines and Albion Motors.[168]\neconomy in Scotland[13][13][14][14][needs update]needs updateneeds updateneeds update[166][166][167][167]Greater GlasgowAggrekoWeir GroupClyde BlowersHowdenLinn ProductsFirebrand GamesWilliam Grant & SonsWhyte and MackayThe Edrington GroupBritish Polar EnginesAlbion Motors[168][168]Glasgow was once one of the most significant cities in the UK for manufacturing, which generated a great deal of the city's wealth; the most prominent industry being shipbuilding based on the River Clyde.[169] Among the historic vessels constructed there were the famed tea clipper Cutty Sark, the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS\u00a0Hood, and the transatlantic luxury liners Aquitania, RMS\u00a0Queen Mary, RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth, and RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II. Although Glasgow owed much of its economic growth to the shipbuilding industry, which still continues today in the form of Ferguson Marine and BAE Systems Maritime - Naval Ships' two shipyards, the city has its roots in the tobacco trade and is noted to have \"risen from its medieval slumber\" from trade in tobacco, pioneered by figures such as John Glassford.[170] The city was also noted for its locomotive construction industry\u2014led by firms such as the North British Locomotive Company\u2014which grew during the 19th century before entering a decline in the 1960s.\n[169][169]Cutty SarkCutty SarkHMS\u00a0HoodHoodAquitaniaRMS\u00a0Queen MaryQueen MaryRMS\u00a0Queen ElizabethQueen ElizabethRMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth IIQueen Elizabeth IIFerguson MarineBAE Systems Maritime - Naval ShipsJohn Glassford[170][170]North British Locomotive Company A view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employers A view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employersA view towards the city centre of Glasgow, home to some of Scotland's largest industries and employersWhilst manufacturing has declined, Glasgow's economy has seen significant relative growth of tertiary sector industries such as financial and business services (centred around the International Financial Services District on the Broomielaw, once a stretch of riverside warehouses replaced by modern office blocks), communications, biosciences, creative industries, healthcare, higher education, retail and tourism.[171] Glasgow is now the second most popular foreign tourist destination in Scotland (fifth in the UK)[172] and offers Scotland's largest retail centre.\ntertiaryInternational Financial Services DistrictBroomielawbiosciences[171][171][172][172]Between 1998 and 2001, the city's financial services sector grew at a rate of 30%, making considerable gains on Edinburgh, which has historically been the centre of the Scottish financial sector.[173][174] Glasgow is now one of Europe's sixteen largest financial centres,[175] with a growing number of Blue chip financial sector companies establishing significant operations or headquarters in the city.[176]\n[173][173][174][174][175][175]Blue chip[176][176]The 1990s and first decade of the 21st century saw substantial growth in the number of call centres based in Glasgow. In 2007 roughly 20,000 people, a third of all call centre employees in Scotland, were employed by Glasgow call centres.[177] This growth and its high use of recruitment agencies to hire graduates as temporary workers has led to accusations of exploitative practices such as long hours, poor pay and lack of job security by the TUC and other union bodies.[178] In recent years some call centres have taken steps to rectify this criticism.[citation needed]\ncall centres[177][177]TUC[178][178][citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededThe city's main manufacturing industries include companies involved in; shipbuilding, engineering, construction, brewing and distilling, printing and publishing, chemicals and textiles as well as newer growth sectors such as optoelectronics, software development and biotechnology.[179] Glasgow forms the western part of the Silicon Glen high tech sector of Scotland with consumer electronics companies such as RHA Technologies headquartered.\noptoelectronicssoftware developmentbiotechnology[179][179]Silicon GlenRHA TechnologiesTransport[edit]Transport[edit][edit]See also: transport in Glasgowtransport in GlasgowPublic transport[edit]Public transport[edit][edit] Glasgow Central station is the northern terminus of the West Coast Main Line.

Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, high ceilings and original period features.[189] The Hyndland area of Glasgow became the first tenement conservation area in the UK[190] and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.\ntenementssandstone[188][188][189][189]Hyndland[190][190]Like many cities in the UK, Glasgow witnessed the construction of high-rise housing in tower blocks in the 1960s, along with large overspill estates on the periphery of the city, in areas like Pollok, Nitshill, Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Milton and Drumchapel.[191] These were built to replace the decaying inner-city tenement buildings originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, to feed the local demand for labour.[192] The massive demand at that time outstripped the pace of new building, and many originally fine tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary.[193] Many degenerated into infamous slums, such as the Gorbals.\ntower blocksoverspill estatesPollokNitshillCastlemilkEasterhouseMiltonDrumchapel[191][191][192][192][193][193]slums 20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough Road 20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough Road20th-century-style houses within the neighbourhood of Hillsborough RoadEfforts to improve this housing situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust in the late 19th century, cleared the slums of the old town areas such as the Trongate, High Street and Glasgow Cross.[194] Subsequent urban renewal initiatives, such as those motivated by the Bruce Report, entailed the comprehensive demolition of slum tenement areas, the development of new towns on the periphery of the city, and the construction of tower blocks.\nTrongateHigh StreetGlasgow Cross[194][194]urban renewalBruce Reportnew townsThe policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful.[195] Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s[195] and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed many fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.[189] The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396\u00a0million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.[196]\n[195][195][195][195][189][189]Glasgow Housing Association[196][196]Healthcare[edit]Healthcare[edit][edit] Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the largest hospital campus in Europe.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library": {"title": "Library", "content": "Organized collection of books or other information resources\nFor other uses, see Library (disambiguation).\n\n\n The Library of the Palais Bourbon in Paris\n Duke Humfrey's Library, Oxford, England\nA library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes. A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.\nA library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.\nLibrary buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet. The library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library, for example. Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.\nThe services the library offers are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination \"library and information services\", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n2 Etymology\n3 Changing roles and content\n4 Librarians/information specialists\n5 Types\n\n5.1 Academic libraries\n5.2 Children's libraries\n5.3 National libraries\n5.4 Public lending libraries\n5.5 Reference libraries\n5.6 Research libraries\n5.7 Digital libraries\n5.8 Special libraries\n\n\n6 Organization\n7 Usage\n\n7.1 Shift to digital libraries\n7.2 The Internet\n\n\n8 Associations\n9 International protection\n10 See also\n\n10.1 Lists of libraries\n\n\n11 References\n12 Further reading\n13 External links\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of libraries\n The Sistine Hall of the Vatican Library.\nThe history of libraries began with the first efforts to organize collections of documents.[1] The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing\u2014the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria.\nThe Fatimids (r. 909\u20131171) also possessed many great libraries within their domains. The historian Ibn Abi Tayyi\u2019 describes their palace library, which probably contained the largest collection of literature on earth at the time, as a \"wonder of the world\". Throughout history, along with bloody massacres, the destruction of libraries has been critical for conquerors who wish to destroy every trace of the vanquished community's recorded memory. A prominent example of this can be found in the Mongol massacre of the Nizaris at Alamut in 1256 and the torching of their library, \"the fame of which\", boasts the conqueror Juwayni, \"had spread throughout the world\".[2]\nThe libraries of Timbuktu were established in the fourteenth century and attracted scholars from all over the world.[3]\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe term library is based on the Latin liber for 'book' or 'document', contained in Latin libraria 'collection of books' and librarium 'container for books'. Other modern languages use derivations from Ancient Greek \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 (biblioth\u0113k\u0113), originally meaning 'book container', via Latin bibliotheca (cf. French biblioth\u00e8que or German Bibliothek).[4]\n\nChanging roles and content[edit]\nLibraries may provide physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, table games, video games and other formats. Libraries range widely in size, up to millions of items.[5]\nLibraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the Internet. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to\u2014or cannot afford to\u2014purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research.[6]\nServices offered by a library are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination \"library and information services\", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently. Organizations or departments are often called by one of these names.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13]\n\nLibrarians/information specialists[edit]\nSee also: Education for librarianship\nLibraries are usually staffed by a combination of professionally-trained librarians, paraprofessional staff sometimes called library technicians, and support staff. Some topics related to the education of librarians and allied staff include accessibility of the collection, acquisition of materials, arrangement and finding tools, the book trade, the influence of the physical properties of the different writing materials, language distribution, role in education, rates of literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries for specially targeted audiences, architectural merit, patterns of usage, the role of libraries in a nation's cultural heritage, and the role of government, church or private sponsorship. Since the 1960s, issues of computerization and digitization have arisen.[1]\n\nTypes[edit]\n Poet Laureate Rita Dove's definition of a library at entrance to the Maine State Library in Augusta, Maine, United States. Dove's definition reads \"The library is an arena of possibility, opening both a window into the soul and a door onto the world.\".\nMany institutions make a distinction between a circulating or lending library, where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons, institutions, or other libraries, and a reference library where material is not lent out. Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky[14] and bookmobiles, are generally of the lending type. Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises. Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility. Lamba (2019) reinforced this idea by observing that \"today's libraries have become increasingly multi-disciplinary, collaborative and networked\" and that applying Web 2.0 tools to libraries would \"not only connect the users with their community and enhance communication but will also help the librarians to promote their library's activities, services, and products to target both their actual and potential users\".[15]\n\nAcademic libraries[edit]\nMain article: Academic library\n The round reading room of Maughan Library, the main university library of King's College London, London, England\nAcademic libraries are generally located on college and university campuses and primarily serve the students and faculty of that and other academic institutions. Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part. Library services are sometimes extended to the general public at a fee, some academic libraries create such services in order to enhance literacy levels in their communities.\n\n The University Library at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary\nAcademic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational institutions, such as colleges and universities. Their main functions are to provide support in research, consultancy and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution. Academic libraries house current, reliable and relevant information resources spread through all the disciplines which serve to assuage the information requirements of students and faculty. In cases where not all books are housed some libraries have E-resources, where they subscribe for a given institution they are serving, in order to provide backups and additional information that is not practical to have available as hard copies. Furthermore, most libraries collaborate with other libraries in exchange of books.\nSpecific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours). Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators.\nAcademic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs.[16] These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software. These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom.\n\n The Robarts Library at the University of Toronto, Canada\nThe academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms. In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented. The library provides a \"gateway\" for students and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.[17] Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases, providing research and scholarly writing software, and usually provide computer workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search databases and portals, institutional electronic resources, Internet access, and course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet software). Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations.[18][19] Moreover, academic libraries are increasingly acting as publishers on their own on a not-for-profit basis, especially in the form of fully Open Access institutional publishers.[20]\n\nChildren's libraries[edit]\n\"Children's library\" redirects here. For the collection of digitized books, see Internet Archive's Children's Library.\n A children's library in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1943\nChildren's libraries are special collections of books intended for juvenile readers and usually kept in separate rooms of general public libraries.[21] Some children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children. They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading. Their work supplements that of the public schools.[22][23]\nServices commonly provided by public libraries may include storytelling sessions for infants, toddlers, preschool children, or after-school programs, all with an intention of developing early literacy skills and a love of books. One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries are summer reading programs for children, families, and adults.[24]\nAnother popular reading program for children is PAWS TO READ or similar programs where children can read to certified therapy dogs. Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading. Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.[25]\n\nNational libraries[edit]\nMain article: National library\n Interior of the National Library of Finland in Helsinki, Finland\n National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth\nA national or state library serves as a national repository of information, and has the right of legal deposit, which is a legal requirement that publishers in the country need to deposit a copy of each publication with the library. Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books. Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the repository character.[26][27] The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.\nMany national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfill their duties. The national libraries of Europe participate in The European Library which is a service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).[28]\n\nPublic lending libraries[edit]\nMain article: Public library\n Raczy\u0144ski Library, the public library of Pozna\u0144, Poland\nA public library provides services to the general public. If the library is part of a countywide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system. A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system. Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing. The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted. Typically, libraries issue library cards to community members wishing to borrow books. Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.\n\n A community library in Ethiopia\nMany public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time. For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment. According to a study by the Pennsylvania Library Association, public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths.[29] Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.\n\n Bates Hall, the main reading room of the Boston Public Library, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\nAs the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown. The stack system involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room. This arrangement arose in the 19th century. Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the cast iron and steel frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty). The introduction of electric lights had a huge impact on lighting in libraries. The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks. As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space.\nLibrary 2.0, a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using Web 2.0 technology. Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, use of online social networks by libraries, plug-ins, and widgets.[30] Inspired by Web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a more user-driven institution.\nDespite the importance ascribed to public libraries, their budgets are often cut by legislatures. In some cases, funding has dwindled so much that libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.[31]\n\nReference libraries[edit]\n Main reading room of the New York City Public Library on 5th Avenue c.\u20091910\u20131920\nA reference library does not lend books and other items; instead, they can only be read at the library itself. Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university. Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique. Many lending libraries contain a \"reference section\", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out.[32] Such reference sections may be referred to as \"reading rooms\", which may also include newspapers and periodicals.[33] An example of a reading room is the Hazel H. Ransom Reading Room at the Harry Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin, which maintains the papers of literary agent Audrey Wood.[34]\n\nResearch libraries[edit]\nMain article: Research library\n Quaid-e-Azam Library in Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore, Pakistan\nA research library is a collection of materials on one or more subjects.[35] A research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally include primary as well as secondary sources; it will maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials. A research library is most often an academic or national library, but a large special library may have a research library within its special field, and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries. A large university library may be considered a research library; and in North America, such libraries may belong to the Association of Research Libraries.[36] In the United Kingdom, they may be members of Research Libraries UK (RLUK).[37]\nA research library can be either a reference library, which does not lend its holdings, or a lending library, which does lend all or some of its holdings. Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials. Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization. Examples of research libraries include the British Library, the Bodleian Library at Oxford University and the New York Public Library Main Branch on 42nd Street in Manhattan, State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science.[38][39]\n\nDigital libraries[edit]\nMain article: Digital library\nDigital libraries are libraries that house digital resources. They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably.[40] The definition of a digital library implies that \"a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community.\"[41] Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together. The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use.[42] Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question. Digital objects cannot be preserved passively, they must be curated by digital librarians to ensure the trust and integrity of the digital objects.[43]\nOne of the biggest considerations for digital librarians is the need to provide long-term access to their resources; to do this, there are two issues requiring watchfulness: Media failure and format obsolescence. With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem. A scratched CD-ROM, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem. Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable. Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself. In contrast, format obsolescence is preparatory, because changes are anticipated and solutions are sought before there is a problem.[44]\nFuture trends in digital preservation include: Transparent enterprise models for digital preservation, launch of self-preserving objects, increased flexibility in digital preservation architectures, clearly defined metrics for comparing preservation tools, and terminology and standards interoperability in real time.[44]\n\nSpecial libraries[edit]\nMain article: Special library\n Bookshelf at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library. The top floor contains 180,000 volumes. Since 1977, all new acquisitions are frozen at \u221233\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221236\u00a0\u00b0C) to prevent the spread of insects and diseases.\nMany private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, churches, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work. Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof. In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in a specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library.\nSpecial libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community. Libraries and the LGBTQ community have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community. Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the Women's Library @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history.\n\n The Long Room of the Trinity College Library in Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. It is a legal deposit or \"copyright library\" and is entitled to receive a copy of all books published in the UK.\nSome special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries, and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the institution in question. Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library.\nSpecial libraries are distinguished from special collections, which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area.\nFor more information on specific types of special libraries, see law libraries, medical libraries, music libraries, or transportation libraries.\n\nOrganization[edit]\n Library shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that section\nMost libraries have materials arranged in a specified order according to a library classification system, so that items may be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently.[45] Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored. These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public. Others require patrons to submit a \"stack request\", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see List of closed stack libraries.\nLarger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional librarians.\n\nCirculation (or Access Services) \u2013 Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.[46]\nCollection Development \u2013 Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.\nReference \u2013 Staffs a reference desk answering questions from users (using structured reference interviews), instructing users, and developing library programming. Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are children's literature, young adult literature, and genealogy materials.\nTechnical Services \u2013 Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning weeded materials.\nStacks Maintenance \u2013 Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services. Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.\n Card used by a user to sign out a book\nBasic tasks in library management include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems.[47] More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming). Library materials like books, magazines, periodicals, CDs, etc. are managed by Dewey Decimal Classification Theory and modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory is more practical reliable system for library materials management.[48]\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published several standards regarding the management of libraries through its Technical Committee 46 (TC 46),[49] which is focused on \"libraries, documentation and information centers, publishing, archives, records management, museum documentation, indexing and abstracting services, and information science\". The following is a partial list of some of them:[50]\n\nISO 2789:2006 Information and documentation\u2014International library statistics\nISO 11620:1998 Information and documentation\u2014Library performance indicators\nISO 11799:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Document storage requirements for archive and library materials\nISO 14416:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Requirements for binding of books, periodicals, serials, and other paper documents for archive and library use\u2014Methods and materials\nISO/TR 20983:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Performance indicators for electronic library services\n Butler Library at Columbia University, est. 1759\n National Library of India, Kolkata, est. 1836\nUsage[edit]\n Until the advent of digital catalogues, card catalogues were the traditional method of organizing the list of resources and their location within a large library.\n Reading room at the State and University Library, the national library of Denmark\n Dynix was an early, but long-lasting and popular, digital catalogue.\nSome patrons may not know how to fully use the library's resources. This can be due to individuals' unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use. An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness. In the public libraries of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the library instruction movement, which advocated library user education.[51] One of the early leaders was John Cotton Dana.[52] The basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as information literacy.[53]\nLibraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card catalogue\u2014a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with index cards that identified books and other materials. In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room.[citation needed]\nThe emergence of the Internet, however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as \"webcats\" or as online public access catalogues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access.[54] This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as digital libraries and distributed libraries, as well as older libraries that have been retrofitted. Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing their resources across a series of shelves called bays. Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically, a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging.[citation needed]\nFinland has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world. Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.[55] In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.[56]\n\nShift to digital libraries[edit]\nSee also: Digital library\n Interior of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Alexandria, Egypt, showing both stacks and computer terminals\nIn the 21st century, there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.[57] Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away. For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 and 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000.[58][59]\nThese facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources. In 1999\u20132000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100\u00a0million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23\u00a0million from the previous year.[60] A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8\u00a0million in revenue.[61] Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in Cushing Academy's decision to dispense with its library of printed books\u2014more than 20,000 volumes in all\u2014and switch over entirely to digital media resources.[62]\n\n Stacks of the Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos Library in Mexico City, Mexico\nA 2001 discussion paper exploring changing use of libraries reported decreased library usage by undergraduate students, who had become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library. Finding information by simply searching the Internet is seen as easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students said that finding information online made more sense to them than going to the library. Three-quarters said they did not have enough time to go to the library. While the retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time-saving than visiting a traditional library, research showed that undergraduates are most likely searching only .03% of the entire web.[63]\nIn the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the GoLibrary, that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as El Cerrito del Norte BART station in California.[64]\n\nThe Internet[edit]\n British Museum Reading Room\nA library may make use of the Internet in a number of ways, from creating their own library website to making the contents of its catalogues searchable online. Some specialised search engines such as Google Scholar offer a way to facilitate searching for academic resources such as journal articles and research papers. The Online Computer Library Center allows anyone to search the world's largest repository of library records through its WorldCat online database.[65] Websites such as LibraryThing and Amazon provide abstracts, reviews, and recommendations of books.[65] Libraries provide computers and Internet access to allow people to search for information online.[66] Online information access is particularly attractive to younger library users.[67][68][69][70][71]\nDigitization of books, particularly those that are out-of-print, in projects such as Google Books provides resources for library and other online users. Due to their holdings of valuable material, some libraries are important partners for search engines such as Google in realizing the potential of such projects and have received reciprocal benefits in cases where they have negotiated effectively.[72] As the prominence of and reliance on the Internet has grown, library services have moved the emphasis from mainly providing print resources to providing more computers and more Internet access.[73] Libraries face a number of challenges in adapting to new ways of information seeking that may stress convenience over quality,[74] reducing the priority of information literacy skills.[75] The potential decline in library usage, particularly reference services,[76] puts the necessity for these services in doubt.\nLibrary scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that they market their services if they are to compete with the Internet and mitigate the risk of losing users.[77] This includes promoting the information literacy skills training considered vital across the library profession.[75][78][79] Many US based research librarians rely on the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in order to guide students and faculty in research.[80] However, marketing of services has to be adequately supported financially in order to be successful. This can be problematic for library services that are publicly funded and find it difficult to justify diverting tight funds to apparently peripheral areas such as branding and marketing.[81]\nThe privacy aspect of library usage in the Internet age is a matter of growing concern and advocacy; privacy workshops are run by the Library Freedom Project which teach librarians about digital tools (such as the Tor network) to thwart mass surveillance.[82][83][84]\n\nAssociations[edit]\nSee also: List of library associations\nThe International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) is the leading international association of library organizations. It is the global voice of the library and information profession, and its annual conference provides a venue for librarians to learn from one another.[85]\nLibrary associations in Asia include the Indian Library Association (ILA),[86] Indian Association of Special Libraries and Information Centers (IASLIC),[87] Bengal Library Association (BLA), Kolkata,[88] Pakistan Library Association,[89] the Pakistan Librarians Welfare Organization,[90] the Bangladesh Association of Librarians, Information Scientists and Documentalists, the Library Association of Bangladesh, and the Sri Lanka Library Association (founded 1960).\nNational associations of the English-speaking world include the American Library Association, the Australian Library and Information Association, the Canadian Library Association, the Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa, and the Research Libraries UK (a consortium of 30 university and other research libraries in the United Kingdom). Library bodies such as CILIP (formerly the Library Association, founded 1877) may advocate the role that libraries and librarians can play in a modern Internet environment, and in the teaching of information literacy skills.[78][91] The Nigerian Library Association is the recognized group for librarians working in Nigeria. It was established in 1962 in Ibadan.\nPublic library advocacy is support given to a public library for its financial and philosophical goals or needs. Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as Friends of Libraries and community members. Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide \"economic value to the community\" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media.[92]\n\nInternational protection[edit]\nLibraries are considered part of the cultural heritage and are one of the primary objectives in many state and domestic conflicts and are at risk of destruction and looting. Financing is often carried out by robbing valuable library items. National and international coordination regarding military and civil structures for the protection of libraries is operated by Blue Shield International and UNESCO. From an international perspective, despite the partial dissolution of state structures and very unclear security situations as a result of the wars and unrest, robust undertakings to protect libraries are being carried out.

A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.\nlibrarydigital accessprintedDVDCDbibliographic databasesA library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.\nlibrariansLibrary buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet. The library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library, for example. Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.\nInternetpublic libraryspecial libraryThe services the library offers are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination \"library and information services\", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently.\nContents\n\n1 History\n2 Etymology\n3 Changing roles and content\n4 Librarians/information specialists\n5 Types\n\n5.1 Academic libraries\n5.2 Children's libraries\n5.3 National libraries\n5.4 Public lending libraries\n5.5 Reference libraries\n5.6 Research libraries\n5.7 Digital libraries\n5.8 Special libraries\n\n\n6 Organization\n7 Usage\n\n7.1 Shift to digital libraries\n7.2 The Internet\n\n\n8 Associations\n9 International protection\n10 See also\n\n10.1 Lists of libraries\n\n\n11 References\n12 Further reading\n13 External links\n\nContentsContents\n1 History\n2 Etymology\n3 Changing roles and content\n4 Librarians/information specialists\n5 Types\n\n5.1 Academic libraries\n5.2 Children's libraries\n5.3 National libraries\n5.4 Public lending libraries\n5.5 Reference libraries\n5.6 Research libraries\n5.7 Digital libraries\n5.8 Special libraries\n\n\n6 Organization\n7 Usage\n\n7.1 Shift to digital libraries\n7.2 The Internet\n\n\n8 Associations\n9 International protection\n10 See also\n\n10.1 Lists of libraries\n\n\n11 References\n12 Further reading\n13 External links\n1 History1 History1History2 Etymology2 Etymology2Etymology3 Changing roles and content3 Changing roles and content3Changing roles and content4 Librarians/information specialists4 Librarians/information specialists4Librarians/information specialists5 Types\n\n5.1 Academic libraries\n5.2 Children's libraries\n5.3 National libraries\n5.4 Public lending libraries\n5.5 Reference libraries\n5.6 Research libraries\n5.7 Digital libraries\n5.8 Special libraries\n\n5 Types5Types\n5.1 Academic libraries\n5.2 Children's libraries\n5.3 National libraries\n5.4 Public lending libraries\n5.5 Reference libraries\n5.6 Research libraries\n5.7 Digital libraries\n5.8 Special libraries\n5.1 Academic libraries5.1 Academic libraries5.1Academic libraries5.2 Children's libraries5.2 Children's libraries5.2Children's libraries5.3 National libraries5.3 National libraries5.3National libraries5.4 Public lending libraries5.4 Public lending libraries5.4Public lending libraries5.5 Reference libraries5.5 Reference libraries5.5Reference libraries5.6 Research libraries5.6 Research libraries5.6Research libraries5.7 Digital libraries5.7 Digital libraries5.7Digital libraries5.8 Special libraries5.8 Special libraries5.8Special libraries6 Organization6 Organization6Organization7 Usage\n\n7.1 Shift to digital libraries\n7.2 The Internet\n\n7 Usage7Usage\n7.1 Shift to digital libraries\n7.2 The Internet\n7.1 Shift to digital libraries7.1 Shift to digital libraries7.1Shift to digital libraries7.2 The Internet7.2 The Internet7.2The Internet8 Associations8 Associations8Associations9 International protection9 International protection9International protection10 See also\n\n10.1 Lists of libraries\n\n10 See also10See also\n10.1 Lists of libraries\n10.1 Lists of libraries10.1 Lists of libraries10.1Lists of libraries11 References11 References11References12 Further reading12 Further reading12Further reading13 External links13 External links13External linksHistory[edit]History[edit][edit]Main article: History of librariesHistory of libraries The Sistine Hall of the Vatican Library. The Sistine Hall of the Vatican Library.The Sistine Hall of the Vatican Library.Vatican LibraryThe history of libraries began with the first efforts to organize collections of documents.[1] The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing\u2014the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria.\nhistory of libraries[1][1]archivesearliest form of writingclay tabletscuneiform scriptSumerclassical GreeceClassical periodConstantinopleAlexandriaThe Fatimids (r. 909\u20131171) also possessed many great libraries within their domains. The historian Ibn Abi Tayyi\u2019 describes their palace library, which probably contained the largest collection of literature on earth at the time, as a \"wonder of the world\". Throughout history, along with bloody massacres, the destruction of libraries has been critical for conquerors who wish to destroy every trace of the vanquished community's recorded memory. A prominent example of this can be found in the Mongol massacre of the Nizaris at Alamut in 1256 and the torching of their library, \"the fame of which\", boasts the conqueror Juwayni, \"had spread throughout the world\".[2]\nFatimidsIbn Abi Tayyi\u2019wonder of the worldMongol massacre of the Nizaris[2][2]The libraries of Timbuktu were established in the fourteenth century and attracted scholars from all over the world.[3]\nTimbuktu[3][3]Etymology[edit]Etymology[edit][edit]The term library is based on the Latin liber for 'book' or 'document', contained in Latin libraria 'collection of books' and librarium 'container for books'.

Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to\u2014or cannot afford to\u2014purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research.[6]\nInternet[6][6]Services offered by a library are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination \"library and information services\", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently. Organizations or departments are often called by one of these names.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13]\n[7][7][8][8][9][9][10][10][11][11][12][12][13][13]Librarians/information specialists[edit]Librarians/information specialists[edit][edit]See also: Education for librarianshipEducation for librarianshipLibraries are usually staffed by a combination of professionally-trained librarians, paraprofessional staff sometimes called library technicians, and support staff. Some topics related to the education of librarians and allied staff include accessibility of the collection, acquisition of materials, arrangement and finding tools, the book trade, the influence of the physical properties of the different writing materials, language distribution, role in education, rates of literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries for specially targeted audiences, architectural merit, patterns of usage, the role of libraries in a nation's cultural heritage, and the role of government, church or private sponsorship.

Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky[14] and bookmobiles, are generally of the lending type. Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises. Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility. Lamba (2019) reinforced this idea by observing that \"today's libraries have become increasingly multi-disciplinary, collaborative and networked\" and that applying Web 2.0 tools to libraries would \"not only connect the users with their community and enhance communication but will also help the librarians to promote their library's activities, services, and products to target both their actual and potential users\".[15]\nlending library[14][14]bookmobilesWeb 2.0[15][15]Academic libraries[edit]Academic libraries[edit][edit]Main article: Academic libraryAcademic library The round reading room of Maughan Library, the main university library of King's College London, London, England The round reading room of Maughan Library, the main university library of King's College London, London, EnglandThe round reading room of Maughan Library, the main university library of King's College London, London, EnglandMaughan LibraryKing's College LondonAcademic libraries are generally located on college and university campuses and primarily serve the students and faculty of that and other academic institutions.

Their main functions are to provide support in research, consultancy and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution. Academic libraries house current, reliable and relevant information resources spread through all the disciplines which serve to assuage the information requirements of students and faculty. In cases where not all books are housed some libraries have E-resources, where they subscribe for a given institution they are serving, in order to provide backups and additional information that is not practical to have available as hard copies. Furthermore, most libraries collaborate with other libraries in exchange of books.\ncollaborate with other librariesSpecific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours). Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators.\nAcademic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs.[16] These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software. These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom.\n[16][16] The Robarts Library at the University of Toronto, Canada The Robarts Library at the University of Toronto, CanadaThe Robarts Library at the University of Toronto, CanadaRobarts LibraryUniversity of TorontoThe academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms. In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented. The library provides a \"gateway\" for students and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.[17] Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases, providing research and scholarly writing software, and usually provide computer workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search databases and portals, institutional electronic resources, Internet access, and course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet software). Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations.[18][19] Moreover, academic libraries are increasingly acting as publishers on their own on a not-for-profit basis, especially in the form of fully Open Access institutional publishers.[20]\n[17][17][18][18][19][19]Open Access[20][20]Children's libraries[edit]Children's libraries[edit][edit]\"Children's library\" redirects here.

They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading. Their work supplements that of the public schools.[22][23]\n[21][21][22][22][23][23]Services commonly provided by public libraries may include storytelling sessions for infants, toddlers, preschool children, or after-school programs, all with an intention of developing early literacy skills and a love of books. One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries are summer reading programs for children, families, and adults.[24]\n[24][24]Another popular reading program for children is PAWS TO READ or similar programs where children can read to certified therapy dogs. Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading. Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.[25]\n[25][25]National libraries[edit]National libraries[edit][edit]Main article: National libraryNational library Interior of the National Library of Finland in Helsinki, Finland Interior of the National Library of Finland in Helsinki, FinlandInterior of the National Library of Finland in Helsinki, FinlandNational Library of FinlandHelsinki National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth National Library of Wales, AberystwythNational Library of Wales, AberystwythNational Library of WalesAberystwythA national or state library serves as a national repository of information, and has the right of legal deposit, which is a legal requirement that publishers in the country need to deposit a copy of each publication with the library. Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books. Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the repository character.[26][27] The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.\nnational or state librarylegal depositrepository[26][26][27][27]Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfill their duties.

If the library is part of a countywide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system. A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system. Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing. The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted. Typically, libraries issue library cards to community members wishing to borrow books. Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.\nlibrary cards A community library in Ethiopia A community library in EthiopiaA community library in EthiopiaEthiopiaMany public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time. For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment. According to a study by the Pennsylvania Library Association, public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths.[29] Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.\nPennsylvania Library Association[29][29] Bates Hall, the main reading room of the Boston Public Library, Boston, Massachusetts, United States Bates Hall, the main reading room of the Boston Public Library, Boston, Massachusetts, United StatesBates Hall, the main reading room of the Boston Public Library, Boston, Massachusetts, United StatesBoston Public Library, Boston, Massachusetts, United StatesAs the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown. The stack system involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room. This arrangement arose in the 19th century. Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the cast iron and steel frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty). The introduction of electric lights had a huge impact on lighting in libraries. The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks. As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space.\nstack systemstack systemelectric lightslighting in librariesLibrary 2.0, a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using Web 2.0 technology. Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, use of online social networks by libraries, plug-ins, and widgets.[30] Inspired by Web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a more user-driven institution.\nLibrary 2.0Web 2.0plug-inswidgets[30][30]Despite the importance ascribed to public libraries, their budgets are often cut by legislatures.

Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university. Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique. Many lending libraries contain a \"reference section\", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out.[32] Such reference sections may be referred to as \"reading rooms\", which may also include newspapers and periodicals.[33] An example of a reading room is the Hazel H. Ransom Reading Room at the Harry Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin, which maintains the papers of literary agent Audrey Wood.[34]\n[32][32][33][33]Harry Ransom CenterUniversity of Texas at AustinAudrey Wood[34][34]Research libraries[edit]Research libraries[edit][edit]Main article: Research libraryResearch library Quaid-e-Azam Library in Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore, Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Library in Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore, PakistanQuaid-e-Azam Library in Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore, PakistanQuaid-e-Azam LibraryBagh-e-JinnahA research library is a collection of materials on one or more subjects.[35] A research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally include primary as well as secondary sources; it will maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials. A research library is most often an academic or national library, but a large special library may have a research library within its special field, and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries. A large university library may be considered a research library; and in North America, such libraries may belong to the Association of Research Libraries.[36] In the United Kingdom, they may be members of Research Libraries UK (RLUK).[37]\n[35][35]primarysecondary sourcesacademicnational libraryspecial libraryAssociation of Research Libraries[36][36]Research Libraries UK (RLUK)[37][37]A research library can be either a reference library, which does not lend its holdings, or a lending library, which does lend all or some of its holdings. Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials. Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization. Examples of research libraries include the British Library, the Bodleian Library at Oxford University and the New York Public Library Main Branch on 42nd Street in Manhattan, State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science.[38][39]\nBritish LibraryBodleian LibraryOxford UniversityNew York Public Library Main BranchState Public Scientific Technological Library of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science[38][38][39][39]Digital libraries[edit]Digital libraries[edit][edit]Main article: Digital libraryDigital libraryDigital libraries are libraries that house digital resources. They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably.[40] The definition of a digital library implies that \"a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community.\"[41] Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together. The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use.[42] Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question. Digital objects cannot be preserved passively, they must be curated by digital librarians to ensure the trust and integrity of the digital objects.[43]\n[40][40][41][41][42][42][43][43]One of the biggest considerations for digital librarians is the need to provide long-term access to their resources; to do this, there are two issues requiring watchfulness: Media failure and format obsolescence. With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem. A scratched CD-ROM, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem. Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable. Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself. In contrast, format obsolescence is preparatory, because changes are anticipated and solutions are sought before there is a problem.[44]\n[44][44]Future trends in digital preservation include: Transparent enterprise models for digital preservation, launch of self-preserving objects, increased flexibility in digital preservation architectures, clearly defined metrics for comparing preservation tools, and terminology and standards interoperability in real time.[44]\n[44][44]Special libraries[edit]Special libraries[edit][edit]Main article: Special librarySpecial library Bookshelf at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library.

Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof. In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in a specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library.\nSpecial libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community. Libraries and the LGBTQ community have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community. Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the Women's Library @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history.\nLibraries and the LGBTQ communityWomen's Library @LSE The Long Room of the Trinity College Library in Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.

Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library.\nSpecial libraries are distinguished from special collections, which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area.\nspecial collectionsFor more information on specific types of special libraries, see law libraries, medical libraries, music libraries, or transportation libraries.\nlaw librariesmedical librariesmusic librariestransportation librariesOrganization[edit]Organization[edit][edit] Library shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that section Library shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that sectionLibrary shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that sectionMost libraries have materials arranged in a specified order according to a library classification system, so that items may be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently.[45] Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored. These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public. Others require patrons to submit a \"stack request\", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see List of closed stack libraries.\nlibrary classification[45][45]List of closed stack librariesLarger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional librarians.\nCirculation (or Access Services) \u2013 Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.[46]\nCollection Development \u2013 Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.\nReference \u2013 Staffs a reference desk answering questions from users (using structured reference interviews), instructing users, and developing library programming.

Card used by a user to sign out a book Card used by a user to sign out a bookCard used by a user to sign out a bookCardBasic tasks in library management include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems.[47] More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming). Library materials like books, magazines, periodicals, CDs, etc. are managed by Dewey Decimal Classification Theory and modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory is more practical reliable system for library materials management.[48]\nlibrary management[47][47][48][48]The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published several standards regarding the management of libraries through its Technical Committee 46 (TC 46),[49] which is focused on \"libraries, documentation and information centers, publishing, archives, records management, museum documentation, indexing and abstracting services, and information science\". The following is a partial list of some of them:[50]\nInternational Organization for Standardization[49][49][50][50]ISO 2789:2006 Information and documentation\u2014International library statistics\nISO 11620:1998 Information and documentation\u2014Library performance indicators\nISO 11799:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Document storage requirements for archive and library materials\nISO 14416:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Requirements for binding of books, periodicals, serials, and other paper documents for archive and library use\u2014Methods and materials\nISO/TR 20983:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Performance indicators for electronic library servicesISO 2789:2006 Information and documentation\u2014International library statisticsISO 11620:1998 Information and documentation\u2014Library performance indicatorsISO 11799:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Document storage requirements for archive and library materialsISO 14416:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Requirements for binding of books, periodicals, serials, and other paper documents for archive and library use\u2014Methods and materialsISO/TR 20983:2003 Information and documentation\u2014Performance indicators for electronic library services Butler Library at Columbia University, est. 1759 Butler Library at Columbia University, est. 1759Butler Library at Columbia University, est. 1759Butler LibraryColumbia University National Library of India, Kolkata, est. 1836 National Library of India, Kolkata, est. 1836National Library of India, Kolkata, est. 1836National Library of IndiaKolkataUsage[edit]Usage[edit][edit] Until the advent of digital catalogues, card catalogues were the traditional method of organizing the list of resources and their location within a large library.

This can be due to individuals' unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use. An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness. In the public libraries of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the library instruction movement, which advocated library user education.[51] One of the early leaders was John Cotton Dana.[52] The basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as information literacy.[53]\npublic librarieslibrary instruction[51][51]John Cotton Dana[52][52]information literacy[53][53]Libraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card catalogue\u2014a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with index cards that identified books and other materials. In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room.[citation needed]\ncatalogueindex cards[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededThe emergence of the Internet, however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as \"webcats\" or as online public access catalogues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access.[54] This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as digital libraries and distributed libraries, as well as older libraries that have been retrofitted. Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing their resources across a series of shelves called bays. Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically, a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging.[citation needed]\nInternetonline public access catalogues[54][54]digital librariesdistributed librariesretrofittedbaysGPSRFID[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededFinland has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world. Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.[55] In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.[56]\nFinland[55][55][56][56]Shift to digital libraries[edit]Shift to digital libraries[edit][edit]See also: Digital libraryDigital library Interior of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Alexandria, Egypt, showing both stacks and computer terminals Interior of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Alexandria, Egypt, showing both stacks and computer terminalsInterior of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Alexandria, Egypt, showing both stacks and computer terminalsBibliotheca AlexandrinaIn the 21st century, there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.[57] Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away. For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 and 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000.[58][59]\n[57][57][58][58][59][59]These facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources. In 1999\u20132000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100\u00a0million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23\u00a0million from the previous year.[60] A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8\u00a0million in revenue.[61] Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in Cushing Academy's decision to dispense with its library of printed books\u2014more than 20,000 volumes in all\u2014and switch over entirely to digital media resources.[62]\n[60][60][61][61]Cushing Academy[62][62] Stacks of the Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos Library in Mexico City, Mexico Stacks of the Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos Library in Mexico City, MexicoStacks of the Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos Library in Mexico City, MexicoJos\u00e9 Vasconcelos LibraryA 2001 discussion paper exploring changing use of libraries reported decreased library usage by undergraduate students, who had become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library. Finding information by simply searching the Internet is seen as easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students said that finding information online made more sense to them than going to the library. Three-quarters said they did not have enough time to go to the library. While the retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time-saving than visiting a traditional library, research showed that undergraduates are most likely searching only .03% of the entire web.[63]\n[63][63]In the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the GoLibrary, that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as El Cerrito del Norte BART station in California.[64]\nGoLibraryEl Cerrito del NorteBART stationCalifornia[64][64]The Internet[edit]The Internet[edit][edit] British Museum Reading Room British Museum Reading RoomBritish Museum Reading RoomBritish Museum Reading RoomA library may make use of the Internet in a number of ways, from creating their own library website to making the contents of its catalogues searchable online. Some specialised search engines such as Google Scholar offer a way to facilitate searching for academic resources such as journal articles and research papers. The Online Computer Library Center allows anyone to search the world's largest repository of library records through its WorldCat online database.[65] Websites such as LibraryThing and Amazon provide abstracts, reviews, and recommendations of books.[65] Libraries provide computers and Internet access to allow people to search for information online.[66] Online information access is particularly attractive to younger library users.[67][68][69][70][71]\nInternetlibrary websitecatalogues searchable onlineGoogle ScholarOnline Computer Library CenterWorldCat[65][65]LibraryThingAmazon[65][65][66][66][67][67][68][68][69][69][70][70][71][71]Digitization of books, particularly those that are out-of-print, in projects such as Google Books provides resources for library and other online users. Due to their holdings of valuable material, some libraries are important partners for search engines such as Google in realizing the potential of such projects and have received reciprocal benefits in cases where they have negotiated effectively.[72] As the prominence of and reliance on the Internet has grown, library services have moved the emphasis from mainly providing print resources to providing more computers and more Internet access.[73] Libraries face a number of challenges in adapting to new ways of information seeking that may stress convenience over quality,[74] reducing the priority of information literacy skills.[75] The potential decline in library usage, particularly reference services,[76] puts the necessity for these services in doubt.\nDigitizationout-of-printGoogle BooksGoogle[72][72]Internet access[73][73]information seeking[74][74]information literacy[75][75]reference services[76][76]Library scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that they market their services if they are to compete with the Internet and mitigate the risk of losing users.[77] This includes promoting the information literacy skills training considered vital across the library profession.[75][78][79] Many US based research librarians rely on the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in order to guide students and faculty in research.[80] However, marketing of services has to be adequately supported financially in order to be successful. This can be problematic for library services that are publicly funded and find it difficult to justify diverting tight funds to apparently peripheral areas such as branding and marketing.[81]\n[77][77][75][75][78][78][79][79]ACRL[80][80][81][81]The privacy aspect of library usage in the Internet age is a matter of growing concern and advocacy; privacy workshops are run by the Library Freedom Project which teach librarians about digital tools (such as the Tor network) to thwart mass surveillance.[82][83][84]\nprivacyLibrary Freedom ProjectTor network[82][82][83][83][84][84]Associations[edit]Associations[edit][edit]See also: List of library associationsList of library associationsThe International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) is the leading international association of library organizations.

Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as Friends of Libraries and community members. Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide \"economic value to the community\" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media.[92]\nPublic library advocacyFriends of Libraries[92][92]International protection[edit]International protection[edit][edit]Libraries are considered part of the cultural heritage and are one of the primary objectives in many state and domestic conflicts and are at risk of destruction and looting. Financing is often carried out by robbing valuable library items. National and international coordination regarding military and civil structures for the protection of libraries is operated by Blue Shield International and UNESCO. From an international perspective, despite the partial dissolution of state structures and very unclear security situations as a result of the wars and unrest, robust undertakings to protect libraries are being carried out. The topic is also the creation of \"no-strike lists\", in which the coordinates of important cultural monuments such as libraries have been preserved.[93][94][95][96]\nBlue Shield

tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air at or near the Earth's surface.[1] Fog can be considered a type of low-lying cloud usually resembling stratus, and is heavily influenced by nearby bodies of water, topography, and wind conditions. In turn, fog affects many human activities, such as shipping, travel, and warfare.\nFog appears when water vapor (water in its gaseous form) condenses. During condensation, molecules of water vapor combine to make tiny liquid water droplets that hang in the air. Sea fog, which shows up near bodies of saline water, is formed as water vapor condenses on bits of salt. Fog is similar to, but less transparent than, mist.\n\nContents\n\n1 Definition\n2 Formation\n3 Types\n4 Freezing conditions\n5 Topographical influences\n6 Sea and coastal fog\n7 Visibility effects\n8 Shadows\n9 Sound propagation and acoustic effects\n10 Record extremes\n11 As a water source\n12 Artificial fog\n13 Historical references\n14 Gallery\n15 See also\n\n15.1 Technology\n15.2 Weather\n15.3 Other\n\n\n16 References\n17 Further reading\n18 External links\n\n\nDefinition[edit]\n A foggy Aura River in Turku, Finland\nThe term fog is typically distinguished from the more generic term cloud in that fog is low-lying, and the moisture in the fog is often generated locally (such as from a nearby body of water, like a lake or the ocean, or from nearby moist ground or marshes).[2]\nBy definition, fog reduces visibility to less than 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi), whereas mist causes lesser impairment of visibility.[3]\nFor aviation purposes in the United Kingdom, a visibility of less than 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) but greater than 999\u00a0m (3,278\u00a0ft) is considered to be mist if the relative humidity is 95% or greater; below 95%, haze is reported.[4][full citation needed]\n\nFormation[edit]\nSee also: Cloud physics\n Minute droplets of water constitute this after-dark radiation fog, with an ambient temperature of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F). Their motion trails are captured as streaks.\n A close-up view of water droplets forming fog. Those outside the camera lens's depth of field appear as orbs.\nFog forms when the difference between air temperature and dew point is less than 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C (4.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[5]\nFog begins to form when water vapor condenses into tiny water droplets that are suspended in the air. Some examples of ways that water vapor is added to the air are by wind convergence into areas of upward motion;[6] precipitation or virga falling from above;[7] daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies, or wet land;[8] transpiration from plants;[9] cool or dry air moving over warmer water;[10] and lifting air over mountains.[11] Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds.[12][13] Fog, like its elevated cousin stratus, is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.[14]\nFog normally occurs at a relative humidity near 100%.[15] This occurs from either added moisture in the air, or falling ambient air temperature.[15] However, fog can form at lower humidities, and can sometimes fail to form with relative humidity at 100%. At 100% relative humidity, the air cannot hold additional moisture, thus, the air will become supersaturated if additional moisture is added.\nFog commonly produces precipitation in the form of drizzle or very light snow. Drizzle occurs when the humidity of fog attains 100% and the minute cloud droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets.[16] This can occur when the fog layer is lifted and cooled sufficiently, or when it is forcibly compressed from above by descending air. Drizzle becomes freezing drizzle when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point.\nThe thickness of a fog layer is largely determined by the altitude of the inversion boundary, which in coastal or oceanic locales is also the top of the marine layer, above which the air mass is warmer and drier. The inversion boundary varies its altitude primarily in response to the weight of the air above it, which is measured in terms of atmospheric pressure. The marine layer, and any fog-bank it may contain, will be \"squashed\" when the pressure is high, and conversely, may expand upwards when the pressure above it is lowering.\n\nTypes[edit]\nFog can form in a number of ways, depending on how the cooling that caused the condensation occurred.\nRadiation fog is formed by the cooling of land after sunset by infrared thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall and reach the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fog occurs at night, and usually does not last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months, especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include tule fog.[17]\nGround fog is fog that obscures less than 60% of the sky and does not extend to the base of any overhead clouds.[18] However, the term is usually a synonym for shallow radiation fog; in some cases the depth of the fog is on the order of tens of centimetres over certain kinds of terrain with the absence of wind.\n\n Advection fog layer in San Francisco with the Golden Gate Bridge and skyline in the background\nAdvection fog occurs when moist air passes over a cool surface by advection (wind) and is cooled.[19] It is common as a warm front passes over an area with significant snow-pack. It is most common at sea when moist air encounters cooler waters, including areas of cold water upwelling, such as along the California coast (see San Francisco fog).  A strong enough temperature difference over water or bare ground can also cause advection fog.\nAlthough strong winds often mix the air and can disperse, fragment, or prevent many kinds of fog, markedly warmer and humid air blowing over a snowpack can continue to generate advection fog at elevated velocities up to 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) or more \u2013 this fog will be in a turbulent, rapidly moving, and comparatively shallow layer, observed as a few centimetres/inches in depth over flat farm fields, flat urban terrain and the like, and/or form more complex forms where the terrain is different such as rotating areas in the lee of hills or large buildings and so on.\nFog formed by advection along the California coastline is propelled onto land by one of several processes. A cold front can push the marine layer coast-ward, an occurrence most typical in the spring or late fall. During the summer months, a low-pressure trough produced by intense heating inland creates a strong pressure gradient, drawing in the dense marine layer. Also, during the summer, strong high pressure aloft over the desert southwest, usually in connection with the summer monsoon, produces a south to southeasterly flow which can drive the offshore marine layer up the coastline; a phenomenon known as a \"southerly surge\", typically following a coastal heat spell. However, if the monsoonal flow is sufficiently turbulent, it might instead break up the marine layer and any fog it may contain. Moderate turbulence will typically transform a fog bank, lifting it and breaking it up into shallow convective clouds called stratocumulus.\nEvaporation fog or steam fog forms over bodies of water overlain by much colder air; this situation can also lead to the formation of steam devils, which look like their dust counterparts.  Lake effect fog is of this type, sometimes in combination with other causes like radiation fog.  It tends to differ from most advective fog formed over land in that it is, like lake-effect snow, a convective phenomenon, resulting in fog that can be very dense and deep and looks fluffy from above.\nFrontal fog forms in much the same way as stratus cloud near a front when raindrops, falling from relatively warm air above a frontal surface, evaporate into cooler air close to the Earth's surface and cause it to become saturated.  This type of fog can be the result of a very low frontal stratus cloud subsiding to surface level in the absence of any lifting agent after the front passes.\nIce fog forms in very low temperatures and can be the result of other mechanisms mentioned here, as well as the exhalation of moist warm air by herds of animals. It can be associated with the diamond dust form of precipitation, in which very small crystals of ice form and slowly fall. This often occurs during blue sky conditions, which can cause many types of halos and other results of refraction of sunlight by the airborne crystals.\nFreezing fog, which deposits rime, is composed of droplets of supercooled water that freeze to surfaces on contact.\nPrecipitation fog (or frontal fog) forms as precipitation falls into drier air below the cloud, the liquid droplets evaporate into water vapor. The water vapor cools and at the dewpoint it condenses and fog forms.\nHail fog sometimes occurs in the vicinity of significant hail accumulations due to decreased temperature and increased moisture leading to saturation in a very shallow layer near the surface. It most often occurs when there is a warm, humid layer atop the hail and when wind is light. This ground fog tends to be localized but can be extremely dense and abrupt. It may form shortly after the hail falls; when the hail has had time to cool the air and as it absorbs heat when melting and evaporating.[20]\nUpslope fog forms when moist air is going up the slope of a mountain or hill (orographic lifting) which condenses into fog on account of adiabatic cooling, and to a lesser extent the drop in pressure with altitude.\n\nFreezing conditions[edit]\nFreezing fog occurs when liquid fog droplets freeze to surfaces, forming white soft or hard rime.[21] This is very common on mountain tops which are exposed to low clouds. It is equivalent to freezing rain, and essentially the same as the ice that forms inside a freezer which is not of the \"frostless\" or \"frost-free\" type. The term \"freezing fog\" may also refer to fog where water vapor is super-cooled, filling the air with small ice crystals similar to very light snow. It seems to make the fog \"tangible\", as if one could \"grab a handful\".\n\n Aerial video of freezing fog in the Okanagan Highlands\nIn the western United States, freezing fog may be referred to as pogonip.[22] It occurs commonly during cold winter spells, usually in deep mountain valleys.\nThe word pogonip is derived from the Shoshone word pa\u03b3i\u0335nappi\u0335h, which means \"cloud\".[22][23]\nIn The Old Farmer's Almanac, in the calendar for December, the phrase \"Beware the Pogonip\" regularly appears.\nIn his anthology Smoke Bellew, Jack London described a pogonip which surrounded the main characters, killing one of them.\nThe phenomenon is also extremely common in the inland areas of the Pacific Northwest, with temperatures in the 10 to 30\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212 to \u22121\u00a0\u00b0C) range. The Columbia Plateau experiences this phenomenon most years due to temperature inversions, sometimes lasting for as long as three weeks. The fog typically begins forming around the area of the Columbia River and expands, sometimes covering the land to distances as far away as LaPine, Oregon, almost 150 miles (240\u00a0km) due south of the river and into south central Washington.\nFrozen fog (also known as ice fog) is any kind of fog where the droplets have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally, this requires temperatures at or below \u221235\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221231\u00a0\u00b0F), making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions.[24] It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Utqia\u0121vik, Alaska. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning freezing fog in Elko, Nevada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPogonip fog in Virginia City, Nevada, from an early 20th-century postcard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce fog on Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Tampere during sunset.\n\n\n\n\nTopographical influences[edit]\nFog over the Pedra do Sino (Bell Rock; left) and Dedo de Deus (God's Finger; right) peaks in the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil\nUp-slope fog or hill fog forms when winds blow air up a slope (called orographic lift), adiabatically cooling it as it rises, and causing the moisture in it to condense. This often causes freezing fog on mountaintops, where the cloud ceiling would not otherwise be low enough.\nValley fog forms in mountain valleys, often during winter. It is essentially a radiation fog confined by local topography, and can last for several days in calm conditions. In California's Central Valley, valley fog is often referred to as tule fog.\n\nSea and coastal fog[edit]\nSea fog (also known as haar or fret) is heavily influenced by the presence of sea spray and microscopic airborne salt crystals.  Clouds of all types require minute hygroscopic particles upon which water vapor can condense. Over the ocean surface, the most common particles are salt from salt spray produced by breaking waves. Except in areas of storminess, the most common areas of breaking waves are located near coastlines, hence the greatest densities of airborne salt particles are there.\nCondensation on salt particles has been observed to occur at humidities as low as 70%, thus fog can occur even in relatively dry air in suitable locations such as the California coast. Typically, such lower humidity fog is preceded by a transparent mistiness along the coastline as condensation competes with evaporation, a phenomenon that is typically noticeable by beachgoers in the afternoon. Another recently discovered source of condensation nuclei for coastal fog is kelp seaweed. Researchers have found that under stress (intense sunlight, strong evaporation, etc.), kelp releases particles of iodine which in turn become nuclei for condensation of water vapor, causing fog that diffuses direct sunlight.[25]\nSea smoke, also called steam fog or evaporation fog, is the most localized form and is created by cold air passing over warmer water or moist land.[21] It often causes freezing fog, or sometimes hoar frost.\nArctic sea smoke is similar to sea smoke, but occurs when the air is very cold. Instead of condensing into water droplets, columns of freezing, rising, and condensing water vapor is formed. The water vapor produces the sea smoke fog, and is usually misty and smoke-like.[26]\nGar\u00faa fog near the coast of Chile and Peru,[27] occurs when typical fog produced by the sea travels inland, but suddenly meets an area of hot air. This causes the water particles of fog to shrink by evaporation, producing a \"transparent mist\". Garua fog is nearly invisible, yet it still forces drivers to use windshield wipers because of deposition of liquid water on hard surfaces. Camanchaca is a similar, dense fog.\n\n\n\n\n\nFog rolls into Seattle from the sea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea fog or \"fret\" encroaching on Brighton Pier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea fog in the Arctic Ocean near the island of Jan Mayen\n\n\n\n\nVisibility effects[edit]\n Heavy fog on a road near Baden, Austria\n Light fog reduces visibility on a suburban street, rendering the cyclist very hazy at about 200\u00a0m (220\u00a0yd). The limit of visibility is about 400\u00a0m (440\u00a0yd), which is before the end of the street.\nDepending on the concentration of the droplets, visibility in fog can range from the appearance of haze, to almost zero visibility. Many lives are lost each year worldwide from accidents involving fog conditions on the highways, including multiple-vehicle collisions.\nThe aviation travel industry is affected by the severity of fog conditions. Even though modern auto-landing computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot, personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff. Safe operations are difficult in thick fog, and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve.\nA solution for landing returning military aircraft developed in World War II was called Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO). It involved burning enormous amounts of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog, allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft. The high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations.\n\nShadows[edit]\n Sutro Tower casts a 3-dimensional fog shadow\nShadows are cast through fog in three dimensions. The fog is dense enough to be illuminated by light that passes through gaps in a structure or tree, but thin enough to let a large quantity of that light pass through to illuminate points further on. As a result, object shadows appear as \"beams\" oriented in a direction parallel to the light source. These voluminous shadows are created the same way as crepuscular rays, which are the shadows of clouds.  In fog, it is solid objects that cast shadows.\n\nSound propagation and acoustic effects[edit]\nSee also: Acoustic location, Acoustic shadow, and Foghorn\nSound typically travels fastest and farthest through solids, then liquids, then gases such as the atmosphere. Sound is affected during fog conditions due to the small distances between water droplets, and air temperature differences.\nMolecular effect: Though fog is essentially liquid water, the many droplets are separated by small air gaps. High-pitched sounds have a high frequency, which in turn means they have a short wavelength. To transmit a high frequency wave, air must move back and forth very quickly. Short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets, partially cancelling and dissipating their energy (a process called \"damping\"). In contrast, low pitched notes, with a low frequency and a long wavelength, move the air less rapidly and less often, and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets. Low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further, which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone.[28]\nTemperature effect: A fog can be caused by a temperature inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog, while warmer air sits above it. The inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground, allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface. A temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel, by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer.[29]\n\nRecord extremes[edit]\nParticularly foggy places include[citation needed] Hamilton, New Zealand and Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland (the meeting place of the cold Labrador Current from the north and the much warmer Gulf Stream from the south). Some very foggy land areas in the world include Argentia (Newfoundland) and Point Reyes (California), each with over 200 foggy days per year.[citation needed] Even in generally warmer southern Europe, thick fog and localized fog are often found in lowlands and valleys, such as the lower part of the Po Valley and the Arno and Tiber valleys in Italy; Ebro Valley in northeastern Spain; as well as on the Swiss plateau, especially in the Seeland area, in late autumn and winter.[citation needed] Other notably foggy areas include coastal Chile (in the south); coastal Namibia; Nord, Greenland; and the Severnaya Zemlya islands.[citation needed]\n\nAs a water source[edit]\nRedwood forests in California receive approximately 30\u201340% of their moisture from coastal fog by way of fog drip. Change in climate patterns could result in relative drought in these areas.[30] Some animals, including insects, depend on wet fog as a principal source of water, particularly in otherwise desert climes, as along many African coastal areas. Some coastal communities use fog nets to extract moisture from the atmosphere where groundwater pumping and rainwater collection are insufficient. Fog can be of different type according to climatic conditions.\n\nArtificial fog[edit]\nArtificial fog is man-made fog that is usually created by vaporizing a water- and glycol- or glycerine-based fluid. The fluid is injected into a heated metal block, and evaporates quickly. The resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent. Upon coming into contact with cool outside air, the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog.[31] Such fog machines are primarily used for entertainment applications.\n\nHistorical references[edit]\nSee also: Pea soup fog, Fog of war, and Theatrical smoke and fog\nThe presence of fog has often played a key role in historical events, such as strategic battles. One example is the Battle of Long Island (27 August 1776), when American general George Washington and his command were able to evade imminent capture by the British Army, using fog to conceal their escape. Another example is D-Day (6 June 1944) during World War II, when the Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy, France during fog conditions. Both positive and negative results were reported from both sides during that battle, due to impaired visibility.[32]\n\nGallery[edit]\n\n\n\n\nMaple tree with red leaves in the morning mist, in western Estonia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fog on the field of the Lepp\u00e4lahti ja Kuivaniemi villages in Kuopio, Finland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFog hovering over the valleys surrounding La Silla Observatory.[33]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFog surrounding skyscrapers in the Melbourne city centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight fog over Taipei, Taiwan with Taipei 101 in the background\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFog in London with the Palace of Westminster in the background\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDense fog over Indian subcontinent, captured by NASA's Aqua satellite in December 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFog partially obscuring a mountain in Tirupati in the India summer.\n\n\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nTechnology[edit]\nAnti-fog\nAutomotive lighting\nDecontamination foam\nFog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO)\nFog collection\nFoghorn\nFog machine\nFogging (photography)\nFog lamp\nHead-up display\nRunway visual range\nTransmissometer\nWeather[edit]\nFog season\nHaboob (sandstorm)\nMist\nSan Francisco fog\nSmog\nWhiteout (weather)\nVog\nStratus\nOther[edit]\nMulti-vehicle collision\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Gultepe, Ismail, ed.

An observer on the mountain may say that he or she is in a fog, however, to outside observers a cloud is covering the mountain. (Thomas, P. (2005).

In fact, some people commonly mistake mist for fog. These two are a little bit different as mist is thinner than fog. () Further distinguishing the terms, fog rarely results in rain, while clouds are the common source of rain.\n\n^ \"Federal Meteorological Handbook Number 1: Chapter 8 \u2013 Present Weather\" (PDF).

be considered a type of low-lying cloud usually resembling stratus, and is heavily influenced by nearby bodies of water, topography, and wind conditions. In turn, fog affects many human activities, such as shipping, travel, and warfare.\nFogaerosolwaterdropletsice crystalsEarth[1][1]cloudstratustopographyFog appears when water vapor (water in its gaseous form) condenses. During condensation, molecules of water vapor combine to make tiny liquid water droplets that hang in the air. Sea fog, which shows up near bodies of saline water, is formed as water vapor condenses on bits of salt. Fog is similar to, but less transparent than, mist.\nwater vaporcondensationsaline watercondenses onmistContents\n\n1 Definition\n2 Formation\n3 Types\n4 Freezing conditions\n5 Topographical influences\n6 Sea and coastal fog\n7 Visibility effects\n8 Shadows\n9 Sound propagation and acoustic effects\n10 Record extremes\n11 As a water source\n12 Artificial fog\n13 Historical references\n14 Gallery\n15 See also\n\n15.1 Technology\n15.2 Weather\n15.3 Other\n\n\n16 References\n17 Further reading\n18 External links\n\nContentsContents\n1 Definition\n2 Formation\n3 Types\n4 Freezing conditions\n5 Topographical influences\n6 Sea and coastal fog\n7 Visibility effects\n8 Shadows\n9 Sound propagation and acoustic effects\n10 Record extremes\n11 As a water source\n12 Artificial fog\n13 Historical references\n14 Gallery\n15 See also\n\n15.1 Technology\n15.2 Weather\n15.3 Other\n\n\n16 References\n17 Further reading\n18 External links\n1 Definition1 Definition1Definition2 Formation2 Formation2Formation3 Types3 Types3Types4 Freezing conditions4 Freezing conditions4Freezing conditions5 Topographical influences5 Topographical influences5Topographical influences6 Sea and coastal fog6 Sea and coastal fog6Sea and coastal fog7 Visibility effects7 Visibility effects7Visibility effects8 Shadows8 Shadows8Shadows9 Sound propagation and acoustic effects9 Sound propagation and acoustic effects9Sound propagation and acoustic effects10 Record extremes10 Record extremes10Record extremes11 As a water source11 As a water source11As a water source12 Artificial fog12 Artificial fog12Artificial fog13 Historical references13 Historical references13Historical references14 Gallery14 Gallery14Gallery15 See also\n\n15.1 Technology\n15.2 Weather\n15.3 Other\n\n15 See also15See also\n15.1 Technology\n15.2 Weather\n15.3 Other\n15.1 Technology15.1 Technology15.1Technology15.2 Weather15.2 Weather15.2Weather15.3 Other15.3 Other15.3Other16 References16 References16References17 Further reading17 Further reading17Further reading18 External links18 External links18External linksDefinition[edit]Definition[edit][edit] A foggy Aura River in Turku, Finland A foggy Aura River in Turku, FinlandA foggy Aura River in Turku, FinlandAura RiverTurku, FinlandThe term fog is typically distinguished from the more generic term cloud in that fog is low-lying, and the moisture in the fog is often generated locally (such as from a nearby body of water, like a lake or the ocean, or from nearby moist ground or marshes).[2]\nfogcloudmarshes[2][2]By definition, fog reduces visibility to less than 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi), whereas mist causes lesser impairment of visibility.[3]\nvisibilitymist[3][3]For aviation purposes in the United Kingdom, a visibility of less than 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) but greater than 999\u00a0m (3,278\u00a0ft) is considered to be mist if the relative humidity is 95% or greater; below 95%, haze is reported.[4][full citation needed]\nUnited Kingdomrelative humidityhaze[4][4][full citation needed]full citation neededfull citation neededfull citation neededFormation[edit]Formation[edit][edit]See also: Cloud physicsCloud physics Minute droplets of water constitute this after-dark radiation fog, with an ambient temperature of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F).

Some examples of ways that water vapor is added to the air are by wind convergence into areas of upward motion;[6] precipitation or virga falling from above;[7] daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies, or wet land;[8] transpiration from plants;[9] cool or dry air moving over warmer water;[10] and lifting air over mountains.[11] Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds.[12][13] Fog, like its elevated cousin stratus, is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.[14]\nwater vaporcondenses[6][6]virga[7][7][8][8]transpiration[9][9][10][10][11][11]condensation nuclei[12][12][13][13]stratus[14][14]Fog normally occurs at a relative humidity near 100%.[15] This occurs from either added moisture in the air, or falling ambient air temperature.[15] However, fog can form at lower humidities, and can sometimes fail to form with relative humidity at 100%. At 100% relative humidity, the air cannot hold additional moisture, thus, the air will become supersaturated if additional moisture is added.\nrelative humidity[15][15][15][15]supersaturatedFog commonly produces precipitation in the form of drizzle or very light snow. Drizzle occurs when the humidity of fog attains 100% and the minute cloud droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets.[16] This can occur when the fog layer is lifted and cooled sufficiently, or when it is forcibly compressed from above by descending air. Drizzle becomes freezing drizzle when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point.\nprecipitationdrizzle[16][16]The thickness of a fog layer is largely determined by the altitude of the inversion boundary, which in coastal or oceanic locales is also the top of the marine layer, above which the air mass is warmer and drier. The inversion boundary varies its altitude primarily in response to the weight of the air above it, which is measured in terms of atmospheric pressure. The marine layer, and any fog-bank it may contain, will be \"squashed\" when the pressure is high, and conversely, may expand upwards when the pressure above it is lowering.\naltitudemarine layerTypes[edit]Types[edit][edit]Fog can form in a number of ways, depending on how the cooling that caused the condensation occurred.\ncondensationRadiation fog is formed by the cooling of land after sunset by infrared thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall and reach the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fog occurs at night, and usually does not last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months, especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include tule fog.[17]\nRadiation foginfraredthermal radiationconductionturbulencetule fog[17][17]Ground fog is fog that obscures less than 60% of the sky and does not extend to the base of any overhead clouds.[18] However, the term is usually a synonym for shallow radiation fog; in some cases the depth of the fog is on the order of tens of centimetres over certain kinds of terrain with the absence of wind.\nGround fog[18][18] Advection fog layer in San Francisco with the Golden Gate Bridge and skyline in the background Advection fog layer in San Francisco with the Golden Gate Bridge and skyline in the backgroundAdvection fog layer in San Francisco with the Golden Gate Bridge and skyline in the backgroundAdvection fog layer in San FranciscoGolden Gate BridgeAdvection fog occurs when moist air passes over a cool surface by advection (wind) and is cooled.[19] It is common as a warm front passes over an area with significant snow-pack. It is most common at sea when moist air encounters cooler waters, including areas of cold water upwelling, such as along the California coast (see San Francisco fog).  A strong enough temperature difference over water or bare ground can also cause advection fog.\nAdvection fogadvection[19][19]warm frontupwellingseeSan Francisco fogAlthough strong winds often mix the air and can disperse, fragment, or prevent many kinds of fog, markedly warmer and humid air blowing over a snowpack can continue to generate advection fog at elevated velocities up to 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) or more \u2013 this fog will be in a turbulent, rapidly moving, and comparatively shallow layer, observed as a few centimetres/inches in depth over flat farm fields, flat urban terrain and the like, and/or form more complex forms where the terrain is different such as rotating areas in the lee of hills or large buildings and so on.\nFog formed by advection along the California coastline is propelled onto land by one of several processes. A cold front can push the marine layer coast-ward, an occurrence most typical in the spring or late fall. During the summer months, a low-pressure trough produced by intense heating inland creates a strong pressure gradient, drawing in the dense marine layer. Also, during the summer, strong high pressure aloft over the desert southwest, usually in connection with the summer monsoon, produces a south to southeasterly flow which can drive the offshore marine layer up the coastline; a phenomenon known as a \"southerly surge\", typically following a coastal heat spell. However, if the monsoonal flow is sufficiently turbulent, it might instead break up the marine layer and any fog it may contain. Moderate turbulence will typically transform a fog bank, lifting it and breaking it up into shallow convective clouds called stratocumulus.\nmonsoonstratocumulusEvaporation fog or steam fog forms over bodies of water overlain by much colder air; this situation can also lead to the formation of steam devils, which look like their dust counterparts.  Lake effect fog is of this type, sometimes in combination with other causes like radiation fog.  It tends to differ from most advective fog formed over land in that it is, like lake-effect snow, a convective phenomenon, resulting in fog that can be very dense and deep and looks fluffy from above.\nEvaporation fogsteam fogsteam devilsdust counterpartslake-effect snowFrontal fog forms in much the same way as stratus cloud near a front when raindrops, falling from relatively warm air above a frontal surface, evaporate into cooler air close to the Earth's surface and cause it to become saturated.  This type of fog can be the result of a very low frontal stratus cloud subsiding to surface level in the absence of any lifting agent after the front passes.\nFrontal fogIce fog forms in very low temperatures and can be the result of other mechanisms mentioned here, as well as the exhalation of moist warm air by herds of animals. It can be associated with the diamond dust form of precipitation, in which very small crystals of ice form and slowly fall. This often occurs during blue sky conditions, which can cause many types of halos and other results of refraction of sunlight by the airborne crystals.\nIce fogdiamond dustFreezing fog, which deposits rime, is composed of droplets of supercooled water that freeze to surfaces on contact.\nFreezing fogrimesupercooled waterPrecipitation fog (or frontal fog) forms as precipitation falls into drier air below the cloud, the liquid droplets evaporate into water vapor. The water vapor cools and at the dewpoint it condenses and fog forms.\nPrecipitation fogfrontal fogprecipitationevaporateHail fog sometimes occurs in the vicinity of significant hail accumulations due to decreased temperature and increased moisture leading to saturation in a very shallow layer near the surface. It most often occurs when there is a warm, humid layer atop the hail and when wind is light. This ground fog tends to be localized but can be extremely dense and abrupt. It may form shortly after the hail falls; when the hail has had time to cool the air and as it absorbs heat when melting and evaporating.[20]\nHail foghailabsorbs heatmeltingevaporating[20][20]Upslope fog forms when moist air is going up the slope of a mountain or hill (orographic lifting) which condenses into fog on account of adiabatic cooling, and to a lesser extent the drop in pressure with altitude.\nUpslope fogadiabatic coolingFreezing conditions[edit]Freezing conditions[edit][edit]Freezing fog occurs when liquid fog droplets freeze to surfaces, forming white soft or hard rime.[21] This is very common on mountain tops which are exposed to low clouds. It is equivalent to freezing rain, and essentially the same as the ice that forms inside a freezer which is not of the \"frostless\" or \"frost-free\" type. The term \"freezing fog\" may also refer to fog where water vapor is super-cooled, filling the air with small ice crystals similar to very light snow. It seems to make the fog \"tangible\", as if one could \"grab a handful\".\nFreezing fog.mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}Freezing fogFreezing fogsofthard rime[21][21]freezing rain Aerial video of freezing fog in the Okanagan Highlands Aerial video of freezing fog in the Okanagan HighlandsAerial video of freezing fog in the Okanagan HighlandsAerial videoOkanagan HighlandsIn the western United States, freezing fog may be referred to as pogonip.[22] It occurs commonly during cold winter spells, usually in deep mountain valleys.\nThe word pogonip is derived from the Shoshone word pa\u03b3i\u0335nappi\u0335h, which means \"cloud\".[22][23]\nIn The Old Farmer's Almanac, in the calendar for December, the phrase \"Beware the Pogonip\" regularly appears.\nIn his anthology Smoke Bellew, Jack London described a pogonip which surrounded the main characters, killing one of them.\npogonip[22][22]Shoshonepa\u03b3i\u0335nappi\u0335h[22][22][23][23]The Old Farmer's Almanac,The Old Farmer's AlmanacSmoke BellewJack LondonThe phenomenon is also extremely common in the inland areas of the Pacific Northwest, with temperatures in the 10 to 30\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212 to \u22121\u00a0\u00b0C) range. The Columbia Plateau experiences this phenomenon most years due to temperature inversions, sometimes lasting for as long as three weeks. The fog typically begins forming around the area of the Columbia River and expands, sometimes covering the land to distances as far away as LaPine, Oregon, almost 150 miles (240\u00a0km) due south of the river and into south central Washington.\nLaPine, OregonFrozen fog (also known as ice fog) is any kind of fog where the droplets have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally, this requires temperatures at or below \u221235\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221231\u00a0\u00b0F), making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions.[24] It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Utqia\u0121vik, Alaska. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.\nFrozen fogice fogfrozencrystalsiceArcticAntarctic[24][24]ice crystalsUtqia\u0121vik, Alaskalight pillars\n\n\n\nMorning freezing fog in Elko, Nevada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPogonip fog in Virginia City, Nevada, from an early 20th-century postcard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce fog on Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Tampere during sunset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning freezing fog in Elko, Nevada\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning freezing fog in Elko, Nevada\n\n\n\nMorning freezing fog in Elko, Nevada\n\nMorning freezing fog in Elko, Nevada\nElko, Nevada\n\n\nPogonip fog in Virginia City, Nevada, from an early 20th-century postcard\n\n\n\n\n\nPogonip fog in Virginia City, Nevada, from an early 20th-century postcard\n\n\n\nPogonip fog in Virginia City, Nevada, from an early 20th-century postcard\n\nPogonip fog in Virginia City, Nevada, from an early 20th-century postcard\nVirginia City, Nevada\n\n\nTree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog\n\n\n\n\n\nTree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog\n\n\n\nTree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog\n\nTree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog\n\n\n\nIce fog on Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Tampere during sunset.\n\n\n\n\n\nIce fog on Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Tampere during sunset.\n\n\n\nIce fog on Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Tampere during sunset.\n\nIce fog on Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi, Tampere during sunset.\nPyh\u00e4j\u00e4rviTampereTopographical influences[edit]Topographical influences[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .tmulti .multiimageinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle .thumbcaption{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow>.thumbcaption{text-align:center}}Fog over the Pedra do Sino (Bell Rock; left) and Dedo de Deus (God's Finger; right) peaks in the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park, Rio de Janeiro state, BrazilFog over the Pedra do Sino (Bell Rock; left) and Dedo de Deus (God's Finger; right) peaks in the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park, Rio de Janeiro state, BrazilFog over the Pedra do Sino (Bell Rock; left) and Dedo de Deus (God's Finger; right) peaks in the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park, Rio de Janeiro state, BrazilFog over the Pedra do Sino (Bell Rock; left) and Dedo de Deus (God's Finger; right) peaks in the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park, Rio de Janeiro state, BrazilPedra do SinoDedo de DeusSerra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National ParkRio de Janeiro stateBrazilUp-slope fog or hill fog forms when winds blow air up a slope (called orographic lift), adiabatically cooling it as it rises, and causing the moisture in it to condense.

In California's Central Valley, valley fog is often referred to as tule fog.\nValley fogvalleystopographyCentral Valleytule fogSea and coastal fog[edit]Sea and coastal fog[edit][edit]Sea fog (also known as haar or fret) is heavily influenced by the presence of sea spray and microscopic airborne salt crystals.  Clouds of all types require minute hygroscopic particles upon which water vapor can condense. Over the ocean surface, the most common particles are salt from salt spray produced by breaking waves. Except in areas of storminess, the most common areas of breaking waves are located near coastlines, hence the greatest densities of airborne salt particles are there.\nhaarhaarfretsea spraysalthygroscopicsprayCondensation on salt particles has been observed to occur at humidities as low as 70%, thus fog can occur even in relatively dry air in suitable locations such as the California coast. Typically, such lower humidity fog is preceded by a transparent mistiness along the coastline as condensation competes with evaporation, a phenomenon that is typically noticeable by beachgoers in the afternoon. Another recently discovered source of condensation nuclei for coastal fog is kelp seaweed. Researchers have found that under stress (intense sunlight, strong evaporation, etc.), kelp releases particles of iodine which in turn become nuclei for condensation of water vapor, causing fog that diffuses direct sunlight.[25]\nkelpiodine[25][25]Sea smoke, also called steam fog or evaporation fog, is the most localized form and is created by cold air passing over warmer water or moist land.[21] It often causes freezing fog, or sometimes hoar frost.\nSea smokeSea smokesteam fogsteamevaporation fog[21][21]hoar frostArctic sea smoke is similar to sea smoke, but occurs when the air is very cold. Instead of condensing into water droplets, columns of freezing, rising, and condensing water vapor is formed. The water vapor produces the sea smoke fog, and is usually misty and smoke-like.[26]\nArctic sea smokesea smokesea smoke fog[26][26]Gar\u00faa fog near the coast of Chile and Peru,[27] occurs when typical fog produced by the sea travels inland, but suddenly meets an area of hot air. This causes the water particles of fog to shrink by evaporation, producing a \"transparent mist\". Garua fog is nearly invisible, yet it still forces drivers to use windshield wipers because of deposition of liquid water on hard surfaces. Camanchaca is a similar, dense fog.\nGar\u00faa fogGar\u00faaChilePeru[27][27]windshield wipersCamanchacaCamanchaca\n\n\n\nFog rolls into Seattle from the sea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea fog or \"fret\" encroaching on Brighton Pier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea fog in the Arctic Ocean near the island of Jan Mayen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFog rolls into Seattle from the sea\n\n\n\n\n\nFog rolls into Seattle from the sea\n\n\n\nFog rolls into Seattle from the sea\n\nFog rolls into Seattle from the sea\nSeattle\n\n\nSea fog or \"fret\" encroaching on Brighton Pier\n\n\n\n\n\nSea fog or \"fret\" encroaching on Brighton Pier\n\n\n\nSea fog or \"fret\" encroaching on Brighton Pier\n\nSea fog or \"fret\" encroaching on Brighton Pier\nBrighton Pier\n\n\nSea fog in the Arctic Ocean near the island of Jan Mayen\n\n\n\n\n\nSea fog in the Arctic Ocean near the island of Jan Mayen\n\n\n\nSea fog in the Arctic Ocean near the island of Jan Mayen\n\nSea fog in the Arctic Ocean near the island of Jan Mayen\nArctic OceanJan MayenVisibility effects[edit]Visibility effects[edit][edit] Heavy fog on a road near Baden, Austria Heavy fog on a road near Baden, AustriaHeavy fog on a road near Baden, AustriaBaden, Austria Light fog reduces visibility on a suburban street, rendering the cyclist very hazy at about 200\u00a0m (220\u00a0yd).

The limit of visibility is about 400\u00a0m (440\u00a0yd), which is before the end of the street.Depending on the concentration of the droplets, visibility in fog can range from the appearance of haze, to almost zero visibility. Many lives are lost each year worldwide from accidents involving fog conditions on the highways, including multiple-vehicle collisions.\nmultiple-vehicle collisionsThe aviation travel industry is affected by the severity of fog conditions. Even though modern auto-landing computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot, personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff. Safe operations are difficult in thick fog, and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve.\nauto-landingcontrol towerA solution for landing returning military aircraft developed in World War II was called Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO). It involved burning enormous amounts of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog, allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft. The high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations.\nFog Investigation and Dispersal OperationShadows[edit]Shadows[edit][edit] Sutro Tower casts a 3-dimensional fog shadow Sutro Tower casts a 3-dimensional fog shadowSutro Tower casts a 3-dimensional fog shadowSutro TowerShadows are cast through fog in three dimensions. The fog is dense enough to be illuminated by light that passes through gaps in a structure or tree, but thin enough to let a large quantity of that light pass through to illuminate points further on. As a result, object shadows appear as \"beams\" oriented in a direction parallel to the light source. These voluminous shadows are created the same way as crepuscular rays, which are the shadows of clouds.  In fog, it is solid objects that cast shadows.\ncrepuscular raysSound propagation and acoustic effects[edit]Sound propagation and acoustic effects[edit][edit]See also: Acoustic location, Acoustic shadow, and FoghornAcoustic locationAcoustic shadowFoghornSound typically travels fastest and farthest through solids, then liquids, then gases such as the atmosphere. Sound is affected during fog conditions due to the small distances between water droplets, and air temperature differences.\nMolecular effect: Though fog is essentially liquid water, the many droplets are separated by small air gaps. High-pitched sounds have a high frequency, which in turn means they have a short wavelength. To transmit a high frequency wave, air must move back and forth very quickly. Short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets, partially cancelling and dissipating their energy (a process called \"damping\"). In contrast, low pitched notes, with a low frequency and a long wavelength, move the air less rapidly and less often, and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets. Low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further, which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone.[28]\nMolecular effect:dampingfoghorns[28][28]Temperature effect: A fog can be caused by a temperature inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog, while warmer air sits above it. The inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground, allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface. A temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel, by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer.[29]\nTemperature effect:temperature inversion[29][29]Record extremes[edit]Record extremes[edit][edit]Particularly foggy places include[citation needed] Hamilton, New Zealand and Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland (the meeting place of the cold Labrador Current from the north and the much warmer Gulf Stream from the south). Some very foggy land areas in the world include Argentia (Newfoundland) and Point Reyes (California), each with over 200 foggy days per year.[citation needed] Even in generally warmer southern Europe, thick fog and localized fog are often found in lowlands and valleys, such as the lower part of the Po Valley and the Arno and Tiber valleys in Italy; Ebro Valley in northeastern Spain; as well as on the Swiss plateau, especially in the Seeland area, in late autumn and winter.[citation needed] Other notably foggy areas include coastal Chile (in the south); coastal Namibia; Nord, Greenland; and the Severnaya Zemlya islands.[citation needed]\n[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededHamilton, New ZealandGrand BanksNewfoundlandLabrador CurrentGulf StreamArgentiaPoint Reyes[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededPo ValleyArnoTiberEbroSwiss plateauSeeland[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededChileNamibiaNord, GreenlandSevernaya Zemlya[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation neededAs a water source[edit]As a water source[edit][edit]Redwood forests in California receive approximately 30\u201340% of their moisture from coastal fog by way of fog drip. Change in climate patterns could result in relative drought in these areas.[30] Some animals, including insects, depend on wet fog as a principal source of water, particularly in otherwise desert climes, as along many African coastal areas. Some coastal communities use fog nets to extract moisture from the atmosphere where groundwater pumping and rainwater collection are insufficient. Fog can be of different type according to climatic conditions.\nRedwoodfog drip[30][30]fog netsArtificial fog[edit]Artificial fog[edit][edit]Artificial fog is man-made fog that is usually created by vaporizing a water- and glycol- or glycerine-based fluid. The fluid is injected into a heated metal block, and evaporates quickly. The resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent. Upon coming into contact with cool outside air, the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog.[31] Such fog machines are primarily used for entertainment applications.\nArtificial fogglycolglycerine[31][31]fog machinesentertainment applicationsHistorical references[edit]Historical references[edit][edit]See also: Pea soup fog, Fog of war, and Theatrical smoke and fogPea soup fogFog of warTheatrical smoke and fogThe presence of fog has often played a key role in historical events, such as strategic battles. One example is the Battle of Long Island (27 August 1776), when American general George Washington and his command were able to evade imminent capture by the British Army, using fog to conceal their escape. Another example is D-Day (6 June 1944) during World War II, when the Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy, France during fog conditions. Both positive and negative results were reported from both sides during that battle, due to impaired visibility.[32]\nBattle of Long IslandGeorge WashingtonD-DayWorld War IINormandy,

Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.[4]\n\nContents\n\n1 Definition\n2 Characteristics\n3 History of imperialism\n\n3.1 Bronze and Iron Age empires\n3.2 Classical period\n3.3 Post-classical period\n3.4 Colonial empires\n3.5 Modern period\n3.6 Transition from empire\n\n\n4 Fall of empires\n\n4.1 Roman Empire\n\n\n5 Contemporary usage\n\n5.1 European Union\n5.2 United States\n\n\n6 Timeline of empires\n7 Theoretical research\n\n7.1 The Seven Stages of Empire\n7.2 Empire versus nation state\n7.3 Universal empire\n7.4 Circumscription theory\n7.5 Present\n7.6 Future\n\n\n8 See also\n\n8.1 Lists\n\n\n9 References\n10 Cited sources and further reading\n11 External links\n\n\nDefinition[edit]\nAn empire is an aggregate of many separate states or territories under a supreme ruler or oligarchy.[5] This is in contrast to a federation, which is an extensive state voluntarily composed of autonomous states and peoples. An empire is a large polity which rules over territories outside of its original borders.\nDefinitions of what physically and politically constitute an empire vary. It might be a state affecting imperial policies or a particular political structure. Empires are typically formed from diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious components.[6] 'Empire' and 'colonialism' are used to refer to relationships between a powerful state or society versus a less powerful one; Michael W. Doyle has defined empire as \"effective control, whether formal or informal, of a subordinated society by an imperial society\".[7]\nTom Nairn and Paul James define empires as polities that \"extend relations of power across territorial spaces over which they have no prior or given legal sovereignty, and where, in one or more of the domains of economics, politics, and culture, they gain some measure of extensive hegemony over those spaces for the purpose of extracting or accruing value\".[8] Rein Taagepera has defined an empire as \"any relatively large sovereign political entity whose components are not sovereign\".[9]\nThe terrestrial empire's maritime analogue is the thalassocracy, an empire composed of islands and coasts which are accessible to its terrestrial homeland, such as the Athenian-dominated Delian League.\nFurthermore, empires can expand by both land and sea. Stephen Howe notes that empires by land can be characterized by expansion over terrain, \"extending directly outwards from the original frontier\"[6] while an empire by sea can be characterized by colonial expansion and empire building \"by an increasingly powerful navy\".[10]\nHowever, sometimes an empire is only a semantic construction, such as when a ruler assumes the title of \"emperor\".[11][12][13][14] That polity over which the ruler reigns logically becomes an \"empire\", despite having no additional territory or hegemony. Examples of this form of empire are the Central African Empire, Mexican Empire, or the Korean Empire proclaimed in 1897 when Korea, far from gaining new territory, was on the verge of being annexed by the Empire of Japan, one of the last to use the name officially. Among the last states in the 20th century known as empires in this sense were the Central African Empire, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Manchukuo, Russia, Germany, and Korea.\nScholars distinguish empires from nation-states.[15][16][17] In an empire, there is a hierarchy whereby one group of people (usually, the metropole) has command over other groups of people, and there is a hierarchy of rights and prestige for different groups of people.[18] Josep Colomer distinguished between empires and nation-states in the following way:\n\nEmpires were vastly larger than states\nEmpires lacked fixed or permanent boundaries whereas a state had fixed boundaries\nEmpires had a \"compound of diverse groups and territorial units with asymmetric links with the center\" whereas a state had \"supreme authority over a territory and population\"\nEmpires had multi-level, overlapping jurisdictions whereas a state sought monopoly and homogenization[16]\nCharacteristics[edit]\nEmpires originated as different types of states, although they commonly began as powerful monarchies. Ideas about empires have changed over time, ranging from public approval to universal distaste. Empires are built out of separate units with some kind of diversity \u2013 ethnic, national, cultural, religious \u2013 and imply at least some inequality between the rulers and the ruled. Without this inequality, the system would be seen as a commonwealth. Throughout history, the major powers of the world constantly seek to conquer other parts of the world. Imperialism is the idea of a major power controlling another nation or land with the intentions to use the native people and resources to help the mother country in any way possible. Many empires were the result of military conquest, incorporating the vanquished states into a political union, but imperial hegemony can be established in other ways. The Athenian Empire, the Roman Empire, and the British Empire developed at least in part under elective auspices. The Empire of Brazil declared itself an empire after separating from the Portuguese Empire in 1822. France has twice transitioned from being called the French Republic to being called the French Empire while it retained an overseas empire.[19]\n\n Diachronic map of the main empires of the modern era (1492\u20131945).\nEuropeans began applying the designation of \"empire\" to non-European monarchies, such as the Qing Empire and the Mughal Empire, as well as the Maratha Empire, eventually leading to the looser denotations applicable to any political structure meeting the criteria of \"imperium\". Some monarchies styled themselves as having greater size, scope, and power than the territorial, politico-military, and economic facts support. As a consequence, some monarchs assumed the title of \"emperor\" (or its corresponding translation, tsar, empereur, kaiser, shah etc.) and renamed their states as \"The Empire of ...\". Empires were seen as an expanding power, administration, ideas and beliefs followed by cultural habits from place to place. Empires tend to impose their culture on the subject states to strengthen the imperial structure. This can have notable effects that outlast the empire itself, both positive and negative. Most histories of empires have been hostile, especially if the authors were promoting nationalism. Stephen Howe, although himself hostile, listed positive qualities: the guaranteed stability, security, and legal order for their subjects. They tried to minimize ethnic and religious antagonism inside the empire. The aristocracies that ruled them were often more cosmopolitan and broad-minded than their nationalistic successors.[20]\nThere are two main ways to establish and maintain an imperial political structure: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion.[21] Territorial empires (e.g. the Macedonian Empire and Byzantine Empire) tend to be contiguous areas. The term, on occasion, has been applied to maritime republics or thalassocracies (e.g. the Athenian and British empires) with looser structures and more scattered territories, often consisting of many islands and other forms of possessions which required the creation and maintenance of a powerful navy. Empires such as the Holy Roman Empire also came together by electing the emperor with votes from member realms through the Imperial election.\n\nHistory of imperialism[edit]\nBronze and Iron Age empires[edit]\nEarly empiresAchaemenid Empire of Persia at its zenithMaurya Empire of India at its greatest extent under Ashoka the Great\nStephen Howe writes that with the exception of the Roman, Chinese and \"perhaps ancient Egyptian states\"; early empires seldom survived the death of their founder and were usually limited in scope to conquest and collection of tribute, having little impact on the everyday lives of their subjects.[22]\nThe earliest known empire appeared in southern Egypt sometime around 3200 BC. Southern Egypt was divided by three kingdoms each centered on a powerful city. Hierapolis conquered the other two cities over two centuries, and later grew into the country of Egypt.[23] The Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad (24th century BC), was an early all-Mesopotamian empire. This imperial achievement was repeated by Hammurabi of Babylon in the 17th century BC. In the 15th century BC, the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, ruled by Thutmose III, was ancient Africa's major force upon incorporating Nubia and the ancient city-states of the Levant.\nCirca 1500 BC in China rose the Shang Empire which was succeeded by the Zhou Empire circa 1100 BC. Both surpassed in territory their contemporary Near Eastern empires. The Zhou Empire dissolved in 770 BC into feudal multi-state system which lasted for five and a half centuries until the universal conquest of Qin in 221 BC. The first empire comparable to Rome in organization was the Neo-Assyrian Empire (916\u2013612 BC). The Median Empire was the first empire within the territory of Persia. By the 6th century BC, after having allied with the Babylonians to defeat the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Medes were able to establish their own empire, which was the largest of its day and lasted for about sixty years.[23]\n\n\nClassical period[edit]\nSee also: Sino-Roman relationsEmpires of the Classical periodRoman Empire under Trajan (98\u2013117). This would be the peak of the empire's territorial extent.Han Empire of China in 2 AD.\nThe Axial Age (mid-First Millennium BC) witnessed unprecedented imperial expansion in the Indo-Mediterranean region and China.[24] The successful and extensive Achaemenid Empire (550\u2013330 BC), also known as the first Persian Empire, covered Mesopotamia, Egypt, parts of Greece, Thrace, the Middle East, much of Central Asia, and North-Western India. It is considered the first great empire in history or the first \"world empire\".[25] It was overthrown and replaced by the short-lived empire of Alexander the Great. His Empire was succeeded by three Empires ruled by the Diadochi\u2014the Seleucid, Ptolemaic, and Macedonian, which, despite being independent, are called the \"Hellenistic Empire\" by virtue of their similarities in culture and administration.\nMeanwhile, in the western Mediterranean the Empires of Carthage and Rome began their rise. Having decisively defeated Carthage in 202 BC, Rome defeated Macedonia in 200 BC and the Seleucids in 190\u2013189 BC to establish an all-Mediterranean Empire. The Seleucid Empire broke apart and its former eastern part was absorbed by the Parthian Empire. In 30 BC Rome annexed Ptolemaic Egypt.\nIn India during the Axial Age appeared the Maurya Empire\u2014a geographically extensive and powerful empire, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BC. The empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya through the help of Chanakya,[26] who rapidly expanded his power westward across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers following the withdrawal by Alexander the Great. By 320 BC, the Maurya Empire had fully occupied northwestern India as well as defeating and conquering the satraps left by Alexander. Under Emperor Asoka the Great, the Maurya Empire became the first Indian empire to conquer the whole Indian Peninsula \u2014 an achievement repeated only twice, by the Gupta and Mughal Empires. In the reign of Asoka Buddhism spread to become the dominant religion in many parts of the ancient India.[23]\nIn 221 BC, China became an empire when the State of Qin ended the chaotic Warring States period through its conquest of the other six states and proclaimed the Qin Empire (221\u2013207 BC). The Qin Empire is known for the construction of the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Army, as well as the standardization of currency, weights, measures and writing system. It laid the foundation for China's first golden age, the Han Empire (202 BC\u2013AD 9, AD 25\u2013220). The Han Empire expanded into Central Asia and established trade through the Silk Road. Confucianism was, for the first time, adopted as an official state ideology. During the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han, the Xiongnu were pacified. By this time, only four empires stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic: the Han Empire of China, the Kushan Empire, the Parthian Empire of Persia, and the Roman Empire. The collapse of the Han Empire in AD 220 saw China fragmented into the Three Kingdoms, only to be unified once again by the Jin Empire (AD 266\u2013420). The relative weakness of the Jin Empire plunged China into political disunity that would last from AD 304 to AD 589 when the Sui Empire (AD 581\u2013618) reunited China.[23]\n\n Map showing the four empires of Eurasia in the 2nd century AD\nThe Romans were the first people to invent and embody the concept of empire in their two mandates: to wage war and to make and execute laws.[4] They were the most extensive Western empire until the early modern period, and left a lasting impact on European society. Many languages, cultural values, religious institutions, political divisions, urban centers, and legal systems can trace their origins to the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire governed and rested on exploitative actions. They took slaves and money from the peripheries to support the imperial center.[4] However, the absolute reliance on conquered peoples to carry out the empire's fortune, sustain wealth, and fight wars would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Roman Empire.[4] The Romans were strong believers in what they called their \"civilizing mission\". This term was legitimized and justified by writers like Cicero who wrote that only under Roman rule could the world flourish and prosper.[4] This ideology, that was envisioned to bring a new world order, was eventually spread across the Mediterranean world and beyond. People started to build houses like Romans, eat the same food, wear the same clothes and engage in the same games.[4] Even rights of citizenship and authority to rule were granted to people not born within Roman territory.[4]\nThe Latin word imperium, referring to a magistrate's power to command, gradually assumed the meaning \"The territory in which a magistrate can effectively enforce his commands\", while the term \"imperator\" was originally an honorific meaning \"commander\". The title was given to generals who were victorious in battle. Thus, an \"empire\" may include regions that are not legally within the territory of a state, but are under either direct or indirect control of that state, such as a colony, client state, or protectorate. Although historians use the terms \"Republican Period\" and \"Imperial Period\" to identify the periods of Roman history before and after absolute power was assumed by Augustus, the Romans themselves continued to refer to their government as a republic, and during the Republican Period, the territories controlled by the republic were referred to as \"Imperium Romanum\". The emperor's actual legal power derived from holding the office of \"consul\", but he was traditionally honored with the titles of imperator (commander) and princeps (first man or, chief). Later, these terms came to have legal significance in their own right; an army calling their general \"imperator\" was a direct challenge to the authority of the current emperor.[27]\nThe legal systems of France and its former colonies are strongly influenced by Roman law.[28] Similarly, the United States was founded on a model inspired by the Roman Republic, with upper and lower legislative assemblies, and executive power vested in a single individual, the president. The president, as \"commander-in-chief\" of the armed forces, reflects the ancient Roman titles imperator princeps.[29] The Roman Catholic Church, founded in the early Imperial Period, spread across Europe, first by the activities of Christian evangelists, and later by official imperial promulgation.\n\nPost-classical period[edit]\nEmpires of the Post-classical periodEastern Roman Empire in 555.The expansion of the Rashidun Empire.The Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire and the Western Xia Empire of China in 1111.The territory directly held by the Tang Empire of China and its sphere of influence.Mongol Empire in the 13th century.Serbian Empire in 1350Almohad Empire 1147 \u2013 1269Bulgarian Empire in 850\nIn Western Asia, the term \"Persian Empire\" came to denote the Iranian imperial states established at different historical periods of pre\u2013Islamic and post\u2013Islamic Persia.[23]\nIn East Asia, various Chinese empires dominated the political, economic and cultural landscapes during this era, the most powerful of which was probably the Tang Empire (618\u2013690, 705\u2013907). Other influential Chinese empires during the post-classical period include the Sui Empire (581\u2013618), the Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire, the Western Xia Empire (1038\u20131227), the Great Jin Empire (1115\u20131234), the Western Liao Empire (1124\u20131218), the Great Yuan Empire (1271\u20131368), and the Great Ming Empire (1368\u20131644). During this period, Japan and Korea underwent voluntary Sinicization.[30][31][32] The Sui, Tang and Song empires had the world's largest economy and were the most technologically advanced during their time;[33][34] the Great Yuan Empire was the world's ninth largest empire by total land area; while the Great Ming Empire is famous for the seven maritime expeditions led by Zheng He.[23]\nThe Ajuran Sultanate was a Somali empire in the medieval times that dominated the Indian Ocean trade. They belonged to the Somali Muslim sultanate[35][36][37] that ruled over large parts of the Horn of Africa in the Middle Ages. Through a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the Ajuran Sultanate successfully resisted an Oromo invasion from the west and a Portuguese incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of Somali maritime enterprise were strengthened or re-established, and foreign trade and commerce in the coastal provinces flourished with ships sailing to and coming from many kingdoms and empires in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and East Africa.[38]\nIn the 7th century, Maritime Southeast Asia witnessed the rise of a Buddhist thallasocracy, the Srivijaya Empire, which thrived for 600 years and was succeeded by the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire that ruled from the 13th to 15th centuries. In the Southeast Asian mainland, the Hindu-Buddhist Khmer Empire was centered in the city of Angkor and flourished from the 9th to 13th centuries. Following the demise of the Khmer Empire, the Siamese Empire flourished alongside the Burmese and Lan Chang Empires from the 13th through the 18th centuries.\nIn Southeastern and Eastern Europe, during 917, the Eastern Roman Empire, sometimes called the Byzantine Empire, was forced to recognize the Imperial title of Bulgarian ruler Simeon the Great, who were then called Tsar, the first ruler to hold that precise imperial title. The Bulgarian Empire, established in the region in 680-681, remained a major power in Southeast Europe until its fall in the late 14th century. Bulgaria gradually reached its cultural and territorial apogee in the 9th century and early 10th century under Prince Boris I and Simeon I, when its early Christianization in 864 allowed it to develop into the cultural and literary center of Slavic Europe, as well as one of the largest states in Europe, thus the period is considered the Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture. Major events included the development of the Cyrillic script at the Preslav Literary School, declared official in 893, and the establishment of the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian.[39][40][41]\nAt the time, in the Medieval West, the title \"empire\" had a specific technical meaning that was exclusively applied to states that considered themselves the heirs and successors of the Roman Empire. Among these were the \"Byzantine Empire\", which was the actual continuation of the Eastern portion of the Roman Empire, the Carolingian Empire, the largely Germanic Holy Roman Empire, and the Russian Empire. Yet, these states did not always fit the geographic, political, or military profiles of empires in the modern sense of the word. To legitimise their imperium, these states directly claimed the title of Empire from Rome. The sacrum Romanum imperium (Holy Roman Empire), which lasted from 800 to 1806, claimed to have exclusively comprehended Christian principalities, and was only nominally a discrete imperial state. The Holy Roman Empire was not always centrally-governed, as it had neither core nor peripheral territories, and was not governed by a central, politico-military elite. Hence, Voltaire's remark that the Holy Roman Empire \"was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire\" is accurate to the degree that it ignores[42] German rule over Italian, French, Proven\u00e7al, Polish, Flemish, Dutch, and Bohemian populations, and the efforts of the ninth-century Holy Roman Emperors (i.e., the Ottonians) to establish central control. Voltaire's \"nor an empire\" observation applies to its late period.\nIn 1204, after the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople, the crusaders established a Latin Empire (1204\u20131261) in that city, while the defeated Byzantine Empire's descendants established two smaller, short-lived empires in Asia Minor: the Empire of Nicaea (1204\u20131261) and the Empire of Trebizond (1204\u20131461).\nConstantinople was retaken in 1261 by the Byzantine successor state centered in Nicaea, re-establishing the Byzantine Empire until 1453, by which time the Turkish-Muslim Ottoman Empire (ca. 1300\u20131918), had conquered most of the region. The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire and it was the most powerful empire to succeed the Abbasi empires at the time, as well as one of the most powerful empires in the world.[43] They became the successors after the Abbasid Empire fell from the Mongols (H\u00fcleg\u00fc Khan). The Ottoman Empire centered on modern day Turkey, dominated the eastern Mediterranean, overthrew the Byzantine Empire to claim Constantinople and it would start battering at Austria and Malta, which were countries that were key to central and to south-west Europe respectively \u2014 mainly for their geographical location.[43] The reason these occurrences of batterings were so important was because the Ottomans were Muslim, and the rest of Europe was Christian, so there was a sense of religious fighting going on.[43] This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims.[43] Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries, and they had problems in them as well.[43] The flows of trade and of cultural influences across the supposed great divide never ceased, so the countries never stopped bartering with each other.[4] These epochal clashes between civilizations profoundly shaped many people's thinking back then, and continues to do so in the present day.[1] Modern hatred against Muslim communities in South-Eastern Europe, mainly in Bosnia and Kosovo, has often been articulated in terms of seeing them as unwelcome residues of this imperialism: in short, as Turks.[44] Moreover, Eastern Orthodox imperialism was not re-established until the coronation of Ivan the Terrible as Emperor of Russia in 1547. Likewise, with the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars (1803\u20131815), the Austrian Empire (1804\u20131867) emerged reconstituted as the Empire of Austria-Hungary (1867\u20131918), having \"inherited\" the imperium of Central and Western Europe from the losers of said wars.\nIn the thirteenth century, Genghis Khan expanded the Mongol Empire to be the largest contiguous empire in the world. However, within two generations, the empire was separated into four discrete khanates under Genghis Khan's grandsons. One of them, Kublai Khan, conquered China and established the Yuan dynasty with the imperial capital at Beijing. One family ruled the whole Eurasian land mass from the Pacific to the Adriatic and Baltic Seas. The emergence of the Pax Mongolica had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia. The Safavid Empire of Iran was also founded.\n[45][46]\nThe Islamic gunpowder empires started to develop from the 15th century.[47]\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the Delhi Sultanate conquered most of the Indian peninsula and spread Islam across it. It later got broken with the establishment of the Bengal Sultanate. In the 15th century, the Mughal Empire was founded by Timur and Genghis Khan's direct descendant Babur. His successors such Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan extended the empire. Meanwhile, the Sur Empire was also established in the north by Sher Shah Suri.\nIn the 17th century, Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir expanded the Mughal Empire, controlling most of the South Asia through Sharia,[48][49] which became the world's largest economy and leading manufacturing power with a nominal GDP that valued a quarter of world GDP, superior than the combination of Europe's GDP.[50][51] It has been estimated that the Mughal emperors controlled an unprecedented one-fourth of the world's entire economy and was home to one-fourth of the world's population at the time.[52]\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb, which marks the end of the medieval India and the beginning of European invasion in India, the empire was weakened by Nader Shah's invasion.[53]\nThe Mysore Empire was soon established by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, allies of Napoleone Bonaparte.[54][55][56] Other independent empires were also been established, such as those ruled by the Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad[57] and Hyderabad State's Nizam of Hyderabad.[58]\nIn the pre-Columbian Americas, two Empires were prominent\u2014the Azteca in Mesoamerica and Inca in Peru. Both existed for several generations before the arrival of the Europeans. Inca had gradually conquered the whole of the settled Andean world as far south as today Santiago in Chile.\nIn Oceania, the Tonga Empire was a lonely empire that existed from the Late Middle Ages to the Modern period.[59]\n\nColonial empires[edit]\nMain article: Colonial empire\n All areas of the world that were once part of the Portuguese Empire.

In the Old World, colonial imperialism was attempted and established on the Canary Islands and Ireland. These conquered lands and people became de jure subordinates of the empire, rather than de facto imperial territories and subjects. Such subjugation often elicited \"client-state\" resentment that the empire unwisely ignored, leading to the collapse of the European colonial imperial system in the late 19th through the mid-20th century. Portuguese discovery of Newfoundland in the New World gave way to many expeditions led by England (later Britain), Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. In the 18th century, the Spanish Empire was at its height because of the great mass of goods taken from conquered territory in the Americas (nowadays Mexico, parts of the United States, the Caribbean, most of Central America, and South America) and the Philippines.\n\n\nModern period[edit]\nEmpires of the Modern periodRed shows self-governing North American British colonies and pink shows claimed and largely indirectly controlled territories in 1775.In 1690, the realms of the Mughal Empire spanned from Kabul in the west to Cape Comorin, Tamil Nadu in the south.[61]Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent.Spanish\u2013Portuguese Empire of the Iberian Union (1580\u20131640) was the first global imperial entity.

Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific, and later Africa, with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the Second British Empire (1783\u20131815), which was followed by the Industrial Revolution and Britain's Imperial Century (1815\u20131914). It became the largest empire in world history, encompassing one quarter of the world's land area and one fifth of its population.[62] The impacts of this period are still prominent in the current age \"including widespread use of the English language, belief in Protestant religion, economic globalization, modern precepts of law and order, and representative democracy.\"[63][64]\nThe Great Qing Empire of China (1636\u20131912) was the fifth largest empire in world history by total land area, and laid the foundation for the modern territorial claims of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China. Apart from having direct control over much of East Asia, the empire also exerted domination over other states through the Chinese tributary system. The multiethnic and multicultural nature of the Great Qing Empire was crucial to the subsequent birth of the nationalistic concept of zhonghua minzu. The empire reached its peak during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, after which the empire entered a period of prolonged decline, culminating in its collapse as a result of the Xinhai Revolution.\nThe Ashanti Empire (or Confederacy), also Asanteman (1701\u20131896), was a West African state of the Ashanti, the Akan people of the Ashanti Region, Akanland in modern-day Ghana. The Ashanti (or Asante) were a powerful, militaristic and highly disciplined people in West Africa. Their military power, which came from effective strategy and an early adoption of European firearms, created an empire that stretched from central Akanland (in modern-day Ghana) to present day Benin and Ivory Coast, bordered by the Dagomba kingdom to the north and Dahomey to the east. Due to the empire's military prowess, sophisticated hierarchy, social stratification and culture, the Ashanti empire had one of the largest historiographies of any indigenous Sub-Saharan African political entity.\nThe Sikh Empire (1799\u20131846) was established in the Punjab region of India. The empire collapsed when its founder, Ranjit Singh, died and its army fell to the British. During the same period, the Maratha Empire (also known as the Maratha Confederacy) was a Hindu state located in present-day India. It existed from 1674 to 1818, and at its peak, the empire's territories covered much of Southern Asia. The empire was founded and consolidated by Shivaji. After the death of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, it expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat, which halted the expansion of the empire. Later, the empire was divided into a confederacy of states which, in 1818, were lost to the British during the Anglo-Maratha wars.[65]\nThe French emperors Napoleon I and Napoleon III (See: Premier Empire, Second French Empire) each attempted establishing a western imperial hegemony centered in France. The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \"first colonial empire,\" that existed until 1814, and the \"second colonial empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second colonial empire came to an end after the decolonizations of Indochina (1954), Algeria (1962) and French Africa. At its apex, it was one of the largest empires in history; including metropolitan France, the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached 11,500,000 km2 (4,400,000 sq mi), with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\nThe Empire of Brazil (1822\u20131889) was the only South American modern monarchy, established by the heir of the Portuguese Empire as an independent nation eventually became an emerging international power. The new country was huge but sparsely populated and ethnically diverse. In 1889 the monarchy was overthrown in a sudden coup d'\u00e9tat led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic.\nThe German Empire (1871\u20131918), another \"heir to the Holy Roman Empire\", arose in 1871.\nThe term \"American Empire\" refers to the United States' cultural ideologies and foreign policy strategies. The term is most commonly used to describe the U.S.'s status since the 20th century, but it can also be applied to the United States' world standing before the rise of nationalism in the 20th century.[66] The United States is not traditionally recognized as an empire, in part because the U.S. adopted a different political system from those that previous empires had used. Despite these systematic differences, the political objectives and strategies of the United States government have been quite similar to those of previous empires.[67] Due to this similarity some scholars confess: \"When it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it's a duck.\"[68][69][70] Academic, Krishna Kumar, argues the distinct principles of nationalism and imperialism may result in common practice; that is, the pursuit of nationalism can often coincide with the pursuit of imperialism in terms of strategy and decision making.[71] Throughout the 19th century, the United States government attempted to expand its territory by any means necessary. Regardless of the supposed motivation for this constant expansion, all of these land acquisitions were carried out by imperialistic means. This was done by financial means in some cases, and by military force in others. Most notably, the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Texas Annexation (1845), and the Mexican Cession (1848) highlight the imperialistic goals of the United States during this \u201cmodern period\u201d of imperialism. The U.S. government has stopped adding additional territories, where they permanently and politically take over since the early 20th century, and instead have established 800 military bases as their outposts.[72] With this overt but subtile military control of other countries, scholars consider U.S. foreign policy strategies to be imperialistic.[73] This idea is explored in the \"contemporary usage\" section.\n\nTransition from empire[edit]\nIn time, an empire may change from one political entity to another. For example, the Holy Roman Empire, a German re-constitution of the Roman Empire, metamorphosed into various political structures (i.e., federalism), and eventually, under Habsburg rule, re-constituted itself in 1804 as the Austrian Empire, an empire of much different politics and scope, which in turn became the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1867. The Roman Empire, perennially reborn, also lived on as the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) \u2013 temporarily splitting into the Latin Empire, the Empire of Nicaea and the Empire of Trebizond before its remaining territory and centre became part of the Ottoman Empire. A similarly persistent concept of empire saw the Mongol Empire become the Khanate of the Golden Horde, the Yuan Empire of China, and the Ilkhanate before resurrection as the Timurid Empire and as the Mughal Empire. After 1945 the Empire of Japan retained its Emperor but lost its colonial possessions and became the State of Japan.\nAn autocratic empire can become a republic (e.g., the Central African Empire in 1979), or it can become a republic with its imperial dominions reduced to a core territory (e.g., Weimar Germany shorn of the German colonial empire (1918\u20131919), or the Ottoman Empire (1918\u20131923)). The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after 1918 provides an example of a multi-ethnic superstate broken into constituent nation-oriented states: the republics, kingdoms, and provinces of Austria, Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czechoslovakia, Ruthenia, Galicia, et al. In the aftermath of World War I the Russian Empire also broke up and became reduced to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) before re-forming as the USSR (1922\u20131991) \u2013 sometimes seen as the core of a Soviet Empire.\nAfter the Second World War (1939\u20131945), the deconstruction of colonial empires quickened and became commonly known as decolonisation. The British Empire evolved into a loose, multinational Commonwealth of Nations, while the French colonial empire metamorphosed to a Francophone commonwealth. The same process happened to the Portuguese Empire, which evolved into a Lusophone commonwealth, and to the former territories of the extinct Spanish Empire, which alongside the Lusophone countries of Portugal and Brazil, created an Ibero-American commowealth. France returned the French territory of Kwang-Chou-Wan to China in 1946. The British gave Hong Kong back to China in 1997 after 150 years of rule. The Portuguese territory of Macau reverted to China in 1999. Macau and Hong Kong did not become part of the provincial structure of China; they have autonomous systems of government as Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China.\nFrance still governs overseas territories (French Guiana, Martinique, R\u00e9union, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Saint Martin, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, Guadeloupe, French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF), Wallis and Futuna, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, and Mayotte), and exerts hegemony in Francafrique (\"French Africa\"; 29 francophone countries such as Chad, Rwanda, etc.). Fourteen British Overseas Territories remain under British sovereignty. Fifteen countries of the Commonwealth of Nations share their head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, as Commonwealth realms.\nIn 2004 Eliot A. Cohen summarized the contemporary transition from empire: \"The Age of Empire may indeed have ended, but then an age of American hegemony has begun, regardless of what one calls it.\"[74]\n\nFall of empires[edit]\nRoman Empire[edit]\nFurther information: Fall of the Western Roman Empire\nThe fall of the western half of the Roman Empire is seen as one of the most pivotal points in all of human history. This event traditionally marks the transition from classical civilization to the birth of Europe. The Roman Empire started to decline at the end of the reign of the last of the Five Good Emperors, Marcus Aurelius in 161\u2013180 A.D. There is still a debate over the cause of the fall of one of the largest empires in history. Piganiol argues that the Roman Empire under its authority can be described as \"a period of terror\",[75] holding its imperial system accountable for its failure. Another theory blames the rise of Christianity as the cause, arguing that the spread of certain Christian ideals caused internal weakness of the military and state.[76] In the book The Fall of the Roman Empire, by Peter Heather, he contends that there are many factors, including issues of money and manpower, which produce military limitations and culminate in the Roman army's inability to effectively repel invading barbarians at the frontier.[77] The Western Roman economy was already stretched to its limit in the 4th and 5th Centuries C.E. due to continual conflict and loss of territory which, in turn, generated loss of revenue from the tax base. There was also the looming presence of the Persians which, at any time, took a large percentage of the fighting force's attention. At the same time the Huns, a nomadic warrior people from the steppes of Asia, are also putting extreme pressure on the German tribes outside of the Roman frontier, which gave the German tribes no other choice, geographically, but to move into Roman territory. At this point, without increased funding, the Roman army could no longer effectively defend its borders against major waves of Germanic tribes. This inability is illustrated by the crushing defeat at Adrianople in 378 C.E. and, later, the Battle of Frigidus.\n\nContemporary usage[edit]\nMain article: Imperialism\nContemporaneously, the concept of empire is politically valid, yet is not always used in the traditional sense. Despite the semantic reference to imperial power, Japan is a de jure constitutional monarchy, with a homogeneous population of 127 million people that is 98.5 percent ethnic Japanese, making it one of the largest nation-states.[78]\nIn his book review of Empire (2000) by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Mehmet Akif Okur posits that since the September 11 attacks in the United States, the international relations determining the world's balance of power (political, economic, military) have been altered. These alterations include the intellectual (political science) trends that perceive the contemporary world's order via the re-territorialization of political space, the re-emergence of classical imperialist practices (the \"inside\" vs. \"outside\" duality, cf. the Other), the deliberate weakening of international organizations, the restructured international economy, economic nationalism, the expanded arming of most countries, the proliferation of nuclear weapon capabilities and the politics of identity emphasizing a state's subjective perception of its place in the world, as a nation and as a civilization. These changes constitute the \"Age of Nation Empires\"; as imperial usage, nation-empire denotes the return of geopolitical power from global power blocs to regional power blocs (i.e., centered upon a \"regional power\" state [China, EU, Russia, US, et al.]) and regional multi-state power alliances (i.e., Mediterranean, Latin America, Southeast Asia). Nation-empire regionalism claims sovereignty over their respective (regional) political (social, economic, ideologic), cultural, and military spheres.[79]\n\nEuropean Union[edit]\nSince the European Union was formed as a polity in 1993, it has established its own currency, its own citizenship, established discrete military forces, and exercises its limited hegemony in the Mediterranean, eastern parts of Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. The big size and high development index of the EU economy often has the ability to influence global trade regulations in its favor. The political scientist Jan Zielonka suggests that this behavior is imperial because it coerces its neighbouring countries into adopting its European economic, legal, and political structures.[80][81][82][83][84][85] Tony Benn, a left-wing Labour Party MP of the United Kingdom, opposed the European integration policies of the European Union by saying, \"I think they're (the European Union) building an empire there, they want us (the United Kingdom) to be a part of their empire and I don't want that.\"[86]\n\nUnited States[edit]\nThe neutrality of this article is disputed.

(May 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nCharacterizing some aspects of the United States in regards to its territorial expansion, foreign policy, and its international behavior as \"American Empire\" is controversial but not uncommon. The controversy stems in part from the fact the US itself was at one point a colony in the British Empire. However, founding fathers such as George Washington noted after the Revolution that the US was an empire in its Infancy, and others like Thomas Jefferson agreed, describing the constitution as the perfect foundation for an \u201cextensive Empire\u201d.[citation needed] Even so, the false ideology that the US was founded on Anti-Imperialist principles has prevented many from acknowledging America's status as an empire. This active rejection of imperialist status is not limited to high-ranking government officials, as it has been ingrained in American society throughout its entire history. As David Ludden explains, \"journalists, scholars, teachers, students, analysts, and politicians prefer to depict the U.S. as a nation pursuing its own interests and ideals\".[87] This often results in imperialist endeavors being presented as measures taken to enhance state security. Ludden explains this phenomenon with the concept of \"ideological blinders\", which he says prevent American citizens from realizing the true nature of America's current systems and strategies. These \"ideological blinders\" that people wear have resulted in an \"invisible\" American empire of which most American citizens are unaware.[87]\nStuart Creighton Miller posits that the public's sense of innocence about Realpolitik (cf. American exceptionalism) impairs popular recognition of US imperial conduct since it governed other countries via surrogates. These surrogates were domestically-weak, right-wing governments that would collapse without US support.[88] Former President G. W. Bush's Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, said: \"We don't seek empires. We're not imperialistic; we never have been.\"[89] This statement directly contradicts Thomas Jefferson who, in the 1780s while awaiting the fall of the Spanish empire, said: \"till our population can be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them piece by piece\".[90][91][92] In turn, historian Sidney Lens argues that from its inception, the US has used every means available to dominate foreign peoples and states.[93]\n\nTimeline of empires[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(April 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe chart below shows a timeline of polities that have been called empires. Dynastic changes are marked with a white line.[23]\n\nThe Roman Empire's timeline listed below includes the Western and Eastern portion.\nThe Empires of Nicaea and Trebizond were Byzantine successor states.\nThe Empire of Bronze Age Egypt is not included in the graph. Established by Narmer circa 3000 BC, it lasted as long as China until it was conquered by Achaemenid Persia in 525 BC.\nJapan is presented for the period of its overseas Empire (1895\u20131945). The original Japanese Empire of \"the Eight Islands\" would be third persistent after Egypt and China.\nMany Indian empires are also included, though only Mauryans, Guptas, Tomars, Delhi Sultans, Mughals, Chauhans and Marathas ruled for large periods in India.\n\nTheoretical research[edit]\nThe Seven Stages of Empire[edit]\nThe military historian Sir John Bagot Glubb studied eleven empires starting with the Assyrians in 859 B.C. and ending with the British in 1950 A.D. Sir John determined that each followed a remarkably similar pattern from birth to demise. Spanning a period of about ten generations, each went through 7 Stages of Empire:[94]\n\nThe Age of Pioneers (Outburst)\nThe Age of Conquests\nThe Age of Commerce\nThe Age of Affluence\nThe Age of Intellect\nThe Age of Decadence\nThe Age of Decline & Collapse\nGlubb noted that in all these example, the penultimate age was marked by defensiveness, pessimism, materialism, frivolity, an influx of foreigners, the Welfare State, and a weakening of religion. He attributed this decadence to an excessively long period of wealth and power, selfishness, love of money, and the loss of a sense of duty.\n\nEmpire versus nation state[edit]\nEmpires have been the dominant international organization in world history:\n\n\nThe fact that tribes, peoples, and nations have made empires points to a fundamental political dynamic, one that helps explain why empires cannot be confined to a particular place or era but emerged and reemerged over thousands of years and on all continents.[95]\n\nEmpires ... can be traced as far back as the recorded history goes; indeed, most history is the history of empires ... It is the nation-state\u2014an essentially 19th-century ideal\u2014that is the historical novelty and that may yet prove to be the more ephemeral entity.[96]\n\nOur field\u2019s fixation on the Westphalian state has tended to obscure the fact that the main actors in global politics, for most of time immemorial, have been empires rather than states ... In fact, it is a very distorted view of even the Westphalian era not to recognize that it was always at least as much about empires as it was states. Almost all of the emerging European states no sooner began to consolidate than they were off on campaigns of conquest and commerce to the farthest reaches of the globe\u2026 Ironically, it was the European empires that carried the idea of the sovereign territorial state to the rest of the world ...[97]\n\nEmpire has been the historically predominant form of order in world politics. Looking at a time frame of several millennia, there was no global anarchic system until the European explorations and subsequent imperial and colonial ventures connected disparate regional systems, doing so approximately 500 years ago. Prior to this emergence of a global-scope system, the pattern of world politics was characterized by regional systems. These regional systems were initially anarchic and marked by high levels of military competition. But almost universally, they tended to consolidate into regional empires ... Thus it was empires\u2014not anarchic state systems\u2014that typically dominated the regional systems in all parts of the world ... Within this global pattern of regional empires, European political order was distinctly anomalous because it persisted so long as an anarchy.[98]\nSimilarly, Anthony Pagden, Eliot A. Cohen, Jane Burbank and Frederick Cooper estimate that \"empires have always been more frequent, more extensive political and social forms than tribal territories or nations have ever been.\"[99] Many empires endured for centuries, while the age of the ancient Egyptian, Chinese and Japanese Empires is counted in millennia. \"Most people throughout history have lived under imperial rule.\"[100]\n\n\nEmpires have played a long and critical part in human history ... [Despite] efforts in words and wars to put national unity at the center of political imagination, imperial politics, imperial practices, and imperial cultures have shaped the world we live in ... Rome was evoked as a model of splendor and order into the Twentieth century and beyond\u2026 By comparison, the nation-state appears as a blip on the historical horizon, a state form that emerged recently from under imperial skies and whose hold on the world's political imagination may well prove partial or transitory\u2026 The endurance of empire challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural, necessary, and inevitable ...[101]\nPolitical scientist Hedley Bull wrote that \"in the broad sweep of human history ... the form of states system has been the exception rather than the rule\".[102] His colleague Robert Gilpin confirmed this conclusion for the pre-modern period:\n\n\nThe history of interstate relations was largely that of successive great empires. The pattern of international political change during the millennia of the pre-modern era has been described as an imperial cycle ... World politics was characterized by the rise and decline of powerful empires, each of which in turn unified and ordered its respective international system. The recurrent pattern in every civilization of which we have knowledge was for one state to unify the system under its imperial domination. The propensity toward universal empire was the principal feature of pre-modern politics.[103]\nHistorian Michael Doyle who undertook an extensive research on empires extended the observation into the modern era:\n\n\nEmpires have been the key actors in world politics for millennia. They helped create the interdependent civilizations of all the continents ... Imperial control stretches through history, many say, to the present day. Empires are as old as history itself ... They have held the leading role ever since.[104]\nUniversal empire[edit]\nExpert on warfare Quincy Wright generalized on what he called \"universal empire\"\u2014empire unifying all the contemporary system:\n\n\nBalance of power systems have in the past tended, through the process of conquest of lesser states by greater states, towards reduction in the number of states involved, and towards less frequent but more devastating wars, until eventually a universal empire has been established through the conquest by one of all those remaining.[105]\nGerman Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck finds that the macro-historic process of imperial expansion gave rise to global history in which the formations of universal empires were most significant stages.[106] A later group of political scientists, working on the phenomenon of the current unipolarity, in 2007 edited research on several pre-modern civilizations by experts in respective fields. The overall conclusion was that the balance of power was inherently unstable order and usually soon broke in favor of imperial order.[107] Yet before the advent of the unipolarity, world historian Arnold Toynbee and political scientist Martin Wight had drawn the same conclusion with an unambiguous implication for the modern world:\n\n\nWhen this [imperial] pattern of political history is found in the New World as well as in the Old World, it looks as if the pattern must be intrinsic to the political history of societies of the species we call civilizations, in whatever part of the world the specimens of this species occur. If this conclusion is warranted, it illuminates our understanding of civilization itself.[108]\n\nMost states systems have ended in universal empire, which has swallowed all the states of the system. The examples are so abundant that we must ask two questions: Is there any states system which has not led fairly directly to the establishment of a world empire? Does the evidence rather suggest that we should expect any states system to culminate in this way? ... It might be argued that every state system can only maintain its existence on the balance of power, that the latter is inherently unstable, and that sooner or later its tensions and conflicts will be resolved into a monopoly of power.[109]\nThe earliest thinker to approach the phenomenon of universal empire from a theoretical point of view was Polybius (2:3):\n\n\nIn previous times events in the world occurred without impinging on one another ... [Then] history became a whole, as if a single body; events in Italy and Libya came to be enmeshed with those in Asia and Greece, and everything gets directed towards one single goal.\nJohann Gottlieb Fichte, having witnessed the battle at Jena in 1806 when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, described what he perceived as a deep historical trend:\n\n\nThere is necessary tendency in every cultivated State to extend itself generally ... Such is the case in Ancient History ... As the States become stronger in themselves and cast off that [Papal] foreign power, the tendency towards a Universal Monarchy over the whole Christian World necessarily comes to light ... This tendency ... has shown itself successively in several States which could make pretensions to such a dominion, and since the fall of the Papacy, it has become the sole animating principle of our History ... Whether clearly or not\u2014it may be obscurely\u2014yet has this tendency lain at the root of the undertakings of many States in Modern Times ... Although no individual Epoch may have contemplated this purpose, yet is this the spirit which runs through all these individual Epochs, and invisibly urges them onward.[110]\nFichte's later compatriot, Geographer Alexander von Humboldt, in the mid-Nineteenth century observed a macro-historic trend of imperial growth in both Hemispheres: \"Men of great and strong minds, as well as whole nations, acted under influence of one idea, the purity of which was utterly unknown to them.\"[111]\nThe imperial expansion filled the world circa 1900.[112][113] Two famous contemporary observers\u2014Frederick Turner and Halford Mackinder described the event and drew implications, the former predicting American overseas expansion[114] and the latter stressing that the world empire is now in sight.[115]\nFriedrich Ratzel, writing at the same time, observed that the \"drive toward the building of continually larger states continues throughout the entirety of history\" and is active in the present.[116] He drew \"Seven Laws of Expansionism\". His seventh law stated: \"The general trend toward amalgamation transmits the tendency of territorial growth from state to state and increases the tendency in the process of transmission.\" He commented on this law to make its meaning clear: \"There is on this small planet sufficient space for only one great state.\"[117]\nTwo other contemporaries\u2014Kang Yu-wei and George Vacher de Lapouge\u2014stressed that imperial expansion cannot indefinitely proceed on the definite surface of the globe and therefore world empire is imminent. Kang Yu-wei in 1885 believed that the imperial trend will culminate in the contest between Washington and Berlin[118] and Vacher de Lapouge in 1899 estimated that the final contest will be between Russia and America in which America is likely to triumph.[119]\nThe above envisaged contests indeed took place, known to us as World War I and II. Writing during the Second, political scientists Derwent Whittlesey, Robert Strausz-Hup\u00e9 and John H. Herz concluded: \u201cNow that the earth is at last parceled out, consolidation has commenced.\u201d[120] In \"this world of fighting superstates there could be no end to war until one state had subjected all others, until world empire had been achieved by the strongest. This undoubtedly is the logical final stage in the geopolitical theory of evolution.\"[121]\n\n\nThe world is no longer large enough to harbor several self-contained powers ... The trend toward world domination or hegemony of a single power is but the ultimate consummation of a power-system engrafted upon an otherwise integrated world.[122]\nWriting in the last year of the War, German Historian Ludwig Dehio drew a similar conclusion:\n\n\n[T]he old European tendency toward division is now being thrust aside by the new global trend toward unification. And the onrush of this trend may not come to rest until it has asserted itself throughout our planet ... The global order still seems to be going through its birth pangs ... With the last tempest barely over, a new one is gathering.[123]\nThe year after the War and in the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein and British Philosopher Bertrand Russell, known as prominent pacifists, outlined for the near future a perspective of world empire (world government established by force). Einstein believed that, unless world government is established by agreement, an imperial world government would come by war or wars.[124] Russell expected a third World War to result in a world government under the empire of the United States.[125] Three years later, another prominent pacifist, Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, generalized on the ancient Empires of Egypt, Babylon, Persia and Greece to imply for the modern world: \"The analogy in present global terms would be the final unification of the world through the preponderant power of either America or Russia, whichever proved herself victorious in the final struggle.\"[126]\nRussian colleague of Russell and Neighbour, Georgy Fedotov, wrote in 1945: All empires are but stages on the way to the sole Empire which must swallow all others. The only question is who will build it and on which foundations. Universal unity is the only alternative to annihilation. Unity by conference is utopian but unity by conquest by the strongest Power is not and probably the uncompleted in this War will be completed in the next. \"Pax Atlantica\" is the best of possible outcomes.[127]\nOriginally drafted as a secret study for the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor of the CIA) in 1944[128] and published as a book three years later, The Struggle for the World... by James Burnham concludes: If either of the two Superpowers wins, the result would be a universal empire which in our case would also be a world empire. The historical stage for a world empire had already been set prior to and independently of the discovery of atomic weapons but these weapons make a world empire inevitable and imminent. \"The atomic weapons ... will not permit the world to wait.\" Only a world empire can establish monopoly on atomic weapons and thus guarantee the survival of civilization. A world empire \"is in fact the objective of the Third World War which, in its preliminary stages, has already began\". The issue of a world empire \"will be decided, and in our day. In the course of the decision, both of the present antagonists may, it is true, be destroyed, but one of them must be.\"[129] In 1951, Hans Morgenthau concluded that the \"best\" outcome of World War III would be world empire:\n\n\nToday war has become an instrument of universal destruction, an instrument that destroys the victor and the vanquished ... At worst, victor and loser would be undistinguishable under the leveling impact of such a catastrophe ... At best, the destruction on one side would not be quite as great as on the other; the victor would be somewhat better off than the loser and would establish, with the aid of modern technology, his domination over the world.[130]\nExpert on earlier civilizations, Toynbee, further developed the subject of World War III leading to world empire:\n\n\nThe outcome of the Third World War ... seemed likely to be the imposition of an ecumenical peace of the Roman kind by the victor whose victory would leave him with a monopoly on the control of atomic energy in his grasp ... This denouement was foreshadowed, not only by present facts, but by historical precedents, since, in the histories of other civilizations, the time of troubles had been apt to culminate in the delivery of a knock-out blow resulting in the establishment of a universal state ...[131]\nThe year this volume of A Study of History was published, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced \"a knock-out blow\" as an official doctrine, a detailed Plan was elaborated and Fortune magazine mapped the design.[132] Section VIII, \"Atomic Armaments\", of the famous National Security Council Report 68 (NSC 68), approved by President Harry Truman in 1951, uses the term \"blow\" 17 times, mostly preceded by such adjectives as \"powerful\", \"overwhelming\", or \"crippling\". Another term applied by the strategists was \"Sunday punch\".[133]\nA pupil of Toynbee, William McNeill, associated on the case of ancient China, which \"put a quietus upon the disorders of the warring states by erecting an imperial bureaucratic structure ... The warring states of the Twentieth century seem headed for a similar resolution of their conflicts.\"[134] The ancient \"resolution\" McNeill evoked was one of the most sweeping universal conquests in world history, performed by Qin in 230\u2013221 BC. Chinese classic Sima Qian (d. 86 BC) described the event (6:234): \"Qin raised troops on grand scale\" and \"the whole world celebrated a great bacchanal\". Herman Kahn of the RAND Corporation criticized to an assembled group of SAC officers their war plan (SIOP-62). He did not use the term bacchanal but he coined on the occasion an associating word: \"Gentlemen, you do not have a war plan. You have a wargasm!\"[135] History did not completely repeat itself but it passed close.\n\nCircumscription theory[edit]\nMain article: Carneiro's circumscription theory\nAccording to the circumscription theory of Robert Carneiro, \"the more sharply circumscribed area, the more rapidly it will become politically unified.\"[136] The Empires of Egypt,[137][138] China[139] and Japan are named the most durable political structures in human history. Correspondingly, these are the three most circumscribed civilizations in human history. The Empires of Egypt (established by Narmer c. 3000 BC) and China (established by Cheng in 221 BC) endured for over two millennia. German Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck, criticizing the Western idea of progress, emphasized that China and Egypt remained at one particular stage of development for millennia. This stage was universal empire. The development of Egypt and China came to a halt once their empires \"reached the limits of their natural habitat\".[140] Sinology does not recognize the Eurocentric view of the \"inevitable\" imperial fall;[141][142] Egyptology[143][144] and Japanology pose equal challenges.\nCarneiro explored the Bronze Age civilizations. Stuart J. Kaufman, Richard Little and William Wohlforth researched the next three millennia, comparing eight civilizations. They conclude: The \"rigidity of the borders\" contributed importantly to hegemony in every concerned case.[145] Hence, \"when the system's borders are rigid, the probability of hegemony is high\".[146]\nThe circumscription theory was stressed in the comparative studies of the Roman and Chinese Empires. The circumscribed Chinese Empire recovered from all falls, while the fall of Rome, by contrast, was fatal. \"What counteracted this [imperial] tendency in Europe ... was a countervailing tendency for the geographical boundaries of the system to expand.\" If \"Europe had been a closed system, some great power would eventually have succeeded in establishing absolute supremacy over the other states in the region\".[147]\n\n\nThe ancient Chinese system was relatively enclosed, whereas the European system began to expand its reach to the rest of the world from the onset of system formation\u2026 In addition, overseas provided outlet for territorial competition, thereby allowing international competition on the European continent to ... trump the ongoing pressure toward convergence.[148]\nIn the 1945 book, The Precarious Balance, on four centuries of the European power struggle, Ludwig Dehio explained the durability of the European states system by its overseas expansion: \"Overseas expansion and the system of states were born at the same time; the vitality that burst the bounds of the Western world also destroyed its unity.\"[149] Edward Carr causally linked the end of the overseas outlet for imperial expansion and World Wars. In the nineteenth century, he wrote during the Second World War, imperialist wars were waged against \"primitive\" peoples. \"It was silly for European countries to fight against one another when they could still ... maintain social cohesion by continuous expansion in Asia and Africa. Since 1900, however, this has no longer been possible: \"the situation has radically changed\". Now wars are between \"imperial powers.\"[150] Hans Morgenthau wrote that the very imperial expansion into relatively empty geographical spaces in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries, in Africa, Eurasia, and western North America, deflected great power politics into the periphery of the earth, thereby reducing conflict. For example, the more attention Russia, France and the United States paid to expanding into far-flung territories in imperial fashion, the less attention they paid to one another, and the more peaceful, in a sense, the world was. But by the late nineteenth century, the consolidation of the great nation-states and empires of the West was consummated, and territorial gains could only be made at the expense of one another.[151] John H. Herz outlined one \"chief function\" of the overseas expansion and the impact of its end:\n\n\n[A] European balance of power could be maintained or adjusted because it was relatively easy to divert European conflicts into overseas directions and adjust them there. Thus the openness of the world contributed to the consolidation of the territorial system. The end of the 'world frontier' and the resulting closedness of an interdependent world inevitably affected the system's effectiveness.[152]\nSome later commentators[who?] drew similar conclusions:\n\n\nFor some commentators, the passing of the Nineteenth century seemed destined to mark the end of this long era of European empire building. The unexplored and unclaimed \"blank\" spaces on the world map were rapidly diminishing ... and the sense of \"global closure\" prompted an anxious fin-de-si\u00e8cle debate about the future of the great empires ... The \"closure\" of the global imperial system implied ... the beginning of a new era of intensifying inter-imperial struggle along borders that now straddled the globe.[153]\nThe opportunity for any system to expand in size seems almost a necessary condition for it to remain balanced, at least over the long haul. Far from being impossible or exceedingly improbable, systemic hegemony is likely under two conditions: \"when the boundaries of the international system remain stable and no new major powers emerge from outside the system.\"[154] With the system becoming global, further expansion is precluded. The geopolitical condition of \"global closure\"[155] will remain to the end of history. Since \"the contemporary international system is global, we can rule out the possibility that geographic expansion of the system will contribute to the emergence of a new balance of power, as it did so many times in the past.\"[156] As Quincy Wright had put it, \"this process can no longer continue without interplanetary wars.\"[157]\nOne of leading experts on world-system theory, Christopher Chase-Dunn, noted that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system, since the global system is circumscribed.[158][159] In fact, within less than a century of its circumscribed existence the global system overcame the centuries-old balance of power and reached the unipolarity. Given \"constant spatial parameters\" of the global system, its unipolar structure is neither historically unusual nor theoretically surprising.[160]\nRandall Schweller theorized that a \"closed international system\", such as the global became a century ago, would reach \"entropy\" in a kind of thermodynamic law. Once the state of entropy is reached, there is no going back. The initial conditions are lost forever. Stressing the curiosity of the fact, Schweller writes that since the moment the modern world became a closed system, the process has worked in only one direction: from many poles to two poles to one pole. Thus unipolarity might represent the entropy\u2014stable and permanent loss of variation\u2014in the global system.[161]\n\nPresent[edit]\nMain article: American empire\nSee also: Pax Americana\n Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar\nChalmers Johnson argues that the US globe-girding network of hundreds of military bases already represents a global empire in its initial form:\n\n\nFor a major power, prosecution of any war that is not a defense of the homeland usually requires overseas military bases for strategic reasons. After the war is over, it is tempting for the victor to retain such bases and easy to find reasons to do so. Commonly, preparedness for a possible resumption of hostilities will be invoked. Over time, if a nation\u2019s aims become imperial, the bases form the skeleton of an empire.[162]\nSimon Dalby associates the network of bases with the Roman imperial system:\n\n\nLooking at these impressive facilities which reproduce substantial parts of American suburbia complete with movie theatres and restaurant chains, the parallels with Roman garrison towns built on the Rhine, or on Hadrian\u2019s wall in England, where the remains are strikingly visible on the landscape, are obvious \u2026 Less visible is the sheer scale of the logistics to keep garrison troops in residence in the far-flung reaches of empire ... That [military] presence literally builds the cultural logic of the garrison troops into the landscape, a permanent reminder of imperial control.[163]\nKenneth Pomeranz and Harvard Historian Niall Ferguson share the above-cited views: \"With American military bases in over 120 countries, we have hardly seen the end of empire.\u201d This \u201cvast archipelago of US military bases \u2026 far exceeds 19th-century British ambitions. Britain\u2019s imperium consisted of specific, albeit numerous, colonies and clients; the American imperial vision is much more global\u2026\u201d[164]\n\n\nConventional maps of US military deployments understate the extent of America's military reach. A Defense Department map of the world, which shows the areas of responsibility of the five major regional commands, suggests that America's sphere of military influence is now literally global \u2026 The regional combatant commanders\u2014the 'pro-consuls' of this imperium\u2014have responsibility for swaths of territory beyond the wildest imaginings of their Roman predecessors.[165]\nAnother Harvard Historian Charles S. Maier opens his Among Empires: American Ascendancy and Its Predecessors with these words: \"What a substratum for empire! Compared with which, the foundation of the Macedonian, the Roman and the British, sink into insignificance.\"[166]\nOne of the most accepted distinctions between earlier empires and the American Empire is the latter's \u201cglobal\u201d or \u201cplanetary\u201d scope.[167] French former Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine wondered: \"The situation is unprecedented: What previous empire subjugated the entire world...?\"[168] The quests for universal empire are old but the present quest outdoes the previous in \"the notable respect of being the first to actually be global in its reach.\"[169] Another Historian Paul Kennedy, who made his name in the 1980s with his prediction of the imminent US \u201cimperial overstretch,\u201d in 2002 acknowledged about the present world system:\n\n\nNothing has ever existed like this disparity of power. The Pax Britannica was run on the cheap. Napoleon\u2019s France and Philip II\u2019s Spain had powerful foes and were part of a multipolar system. Charlemagne\u2019s empire was merely western European in stretch. The Roman Empire stretched further afield, but there was another great empire in Persia and a larger one in China. There is \u2026 no comparison.[170]\nWalter Russell Mead observes that the United States attempts to repeate \u201cglobally\u201d what the ancient empires of Egypt, China and Rome had each accomplished on a regional basis.[171] Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Leeds, Zygmunt Bauman, concludes that due to its planetary dimension, the new empire cannot be drawn on a map:\n\n\nThe new \u2018empire\u2019 is not an entity that could be drawn on a map\u2026 Drawing a map of the empire would also be a pointless exercise because the most conspicuously \u2018imperial\u2019 trait of the new empire\u2019s mode of being consists in viewing and treating the whole of the planet \u2026 as a potential grazing ground\u2026[172]\nTimes Atlas of Empires numbers 70 empires in the world history. Niall Ferguson lists numerous parallels between them and the United States. He concludes: \u201cTo those who would still insist on American exceptionalism, the historian of empires can only retort: as exceptional as all the other 69 empires.\u201d[173] Fareed Zakaria stressed one element not exceptional for the American Empire\u2014the concept of exceptionalism. All dominant empires thought they were special.[174]\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn 1945, Historian Ludwig Dehio predicted global unification due to the circumscription of the global system, although he did not use this term. Being global, the system can neither expand nor be subject to external intrusion as the European states system had been for centuries:\n\n\nIn all previous struggles for supremacy, attempts to unite the European peninsula in a single state have been condemned to failure primarily through the intrusion of new forces from outside the old Occident. The Occident was an open area. But the globe was not, and, for that very reason, ultimately destined to be unified... And this very process [of unification] was clearly reflected in both World Wars.[175]\nFifteen years later, Dehio confirmed his hypothesis: The European system owed its durability to its overseas outlet. \u201cBut how can a multiple grouping of world states conceivably be supported from outside in the framework of a finite globe?\u201d[176]\nDuring the same time, Quincy Wright developed a similar concept. Balance-of-power politics has aimed less at preserving peace than at preserving the independence of states and preventing the development of world empire. In the course of history, the balance of power repeatedly reemerged, but on ever-wider scale. Eventually, the scale became global. Unless we proceed to \u201cinterplanetary wars,\u201d this pattern can no longer continue. In spite of significant reversals, the \u201ctrend towards world unity\u201d can \u201cscarcely be denied.\u201d World unity appears to be \u201cthe limit toward which the process of world history seems to tend.\u201d[177]\nFive scholars\u2014Hornell Hart,[178] Raoul Naroll,[179] Louis Morano,[180] Rein Taagepera[181] and the author of the circumscription theory Robert Carneiro[182][183]\u2014researched expanding imperial cycles.\nThe founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, writing yet in 1943, drew a more specific and immediate future imperial project: After the War America is bound \u201cto take over the command of the skies.\u201d The danger of \u201cthe utter annihilation of all enemy towns and lands\u201d can \u201conly be prevented by the air superiority of a single power ... America\u2019s air role is the only alternative to intercontinental wars.\u201d Despite his outstanding anti-imperialism, Coudenhove-Kalergi detailed:\n\n\nNo imperialism, but technical and strategic problems of security urge America to rule the skies of the globe, just as Britain during the last century ruled the seas of the world... Pacifists and anti-imperialists will be shocked by this logic. They will try to find an escape. But they will try in vain... At the end of the war the crushing superiority of American plane production will be an established fact... The solution of the problem ... is by no means ideal, nor even satisfactory. But it is the minor evil...[184]\nCoudenhove-Kalergi envisaged a kind of Pax Americana modeled on \u201cPax Romana\u201d:\n\n\nDuring the third century BC the Mediterranean world was divided on five great powers\u2014Roma and Carthage, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt. The balance of power led to a series of wars until Rome emerged the queen of the Mediterranean and established an incomparable era of two centuries of peace and progress, the \u2018Pax Romana\u2019... It may be that America\u2019s air power could again assure our world, now much smaller than the Mediterranean at that period, two hundred years of peace...[185]\nThis period would be necessary transitory stage before World State is eventually established, though he did not specify how the last transformation is expected to occur. Coudenhove-Kalergi's follower in the teleological theory of World State, Toynbee, supposed the traditional way of universal conquest and emphasized that the world is ripe for conquest: \"...Hitler's eventual failure to impose peace on the world by the force of arms was due, not to any flaw in his thesis that the world was ripe for conquest, but to an accidental combination of incidental errors in his measures...\" But \"in falling by so narrow a margin to win the prize of world-dominion for himself, Hitler had left the prize dangling within the reach of any successor capable of pursuing the same aims of world-conquest with a little more patience, prudence, and tact.\" With his \"revolution of destruction,\" Hitler has performed the \"yeoman service\" for \"some future architect of a Pax Ecumenica... For a post-Hitlerian empire-builder, Hitler's derelict legacy was a gift of the Gods.\"[186]\nThe next \u201carchitect of a Pax Ecumenica,\u201d known more commonly as Pax Americana, demonstrated \u201cmore patience, prudence, and tact.\u201d Consequently, as President Dwight Eisenhower put it, the NATO allies became \u201calmost psychopathic\u201d whenever anyone talked about a US withdrawal, and the reception of his successor John F. Kennedy in Berlin was \u201calmost hysterical,\u201d as Chancellor Conrad Adenauer characterized it.[187] John Ikenberry finds that the Europeans wanted a stronger, more formal and more imperial system than the United States was initially willing to provide. In the end the United States settled for this \u201cform of empire\u2014a Pax Americana with formal commitments to Europe.\u201d[188] According to a much debated thesis, the United States became \u201cempire by invitation.\u201d[189] The period discussed in the thesis (1945\u20131952) ended precisely the year Toynbee theorized on \"some future architect of a Pax Ecumenica.\u201d\nDissociating America from Rome, Eisenhower gave a pessimistic forecast. In 1951, before he became President, he had written on West Europe: \u201cWe cannot be a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers with our legions if for no other reason than that these are not, politically, our frontiers. What we must do is to assist these [West European] peoples.\u201d Two years later, he wrote: When it was decided to deploy US divisions to Europe, no one had \u201cfor an instant\u201d thought that they would remain there for \u201cseveral decades\u201d\u2014that the United States could \u201cbuild a sort of Roman Wall with its own troops and so protect the world.\u201d[190]\nEisenhower assured Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev on Berlin in 1959: \u201cClearly we did not contemplate 50 years in occupation there.\u201d It lasted, remarks Marc Trachtenberg, from July 1945 to September 1994, 10 months short of 50 years.[191] Notably, when the US troops eventually left, they left eastward. Confirming the theory of the \u201cempire by invitation,\u201d with their first opportunity East European states extended the \u201cinvitation.\u201d[192]\nChalmers Johnson regards the global military reach of the United States as empire in its \u201cinitial\u201d form.[193] Dimitri Simes finds that most of the world sees the United States as a \"nascent\" imperial power.[194] Some scholars concerned how this empire would look in its ultimate form. The ultimate form of empire was described by Michael Doyle in his Empires. It is empire in which its two main components\u2014the ruling core and the ruled periphery\u2014merged to form one integrated whole. At this stage the empire as defined ceases to exist and becomes world state. Doyle examplifies the transformation on the case of the Roman Emperor Caracalla whose legislation in AD 212 extended the Roman citizenship to all inhabitants of the Mediterranean world.[195]\nDoyle's case of the Roman Empire had also been evoked by Susan Strange in her 1988 article, \"The Future of the American Empire.\" Strange emphasized that the most persistent empires were those which best managed to integrate the ruling core and the peripheral allies. The article is partly a reply on the published a year earlier bestseller The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers which predicted imminent US \"imperial overstretch.\" Strange found this outcome unlikely, stressing the fact that the peripheral allies have been successfully recruited into the American Empire.[196]\nEnvisaging a world empire of either the United States or the Soviet Union (whoever is victorious in World War III), Bertrand Russell projected the Roman scenario too: \"Like the Romans, they will, in the course of time, extend citizenship to the vanquished. There will then be a true world state, and it will be possible to forget that it will have owed its origin to conquest.\"[197]\nTo the case of Caracalla, Toynbee added the Abbasid cosmopolitan reformation of 750 AD. Both \"were good auguries for the prospect that, in a post-Modern chapter of Western history, a supranational commonwealth originally based on the hegemony of a paramount power over its satellites might eventually be put on the sounder basis of a constitutional partnership in which all the people of all the partner states would have their fare share in the conduct of common affairs.\u201d[198]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nColonialism\nComparative studies of the Roman and Han empires\nDemocratic empire\nHegemony\nHistorical powers\nImperialism\nLinguistic imperialism\nMilitary globalization\nNomadic empire\nSoviet Empire\nWorld government\n\nLists[edit]\n\nList of empires\nList of largest empires\nList of former sovereign states\nList of transcontinental countries\nList of Hindu empires and dynasties\n\nReferences[edit]\nCitations\n\n\n^ a b Howe 2002, p.\u00a030.\n\n^ a b Howe 2002, p.\u00a035.\n\n^ \"Empire\".

[...] 'In less than a generation, provinces [became] kingdoms.'

created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries\".[1] Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state called an empire and whose head of state is an emperor; but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called empires or ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples).\nempire[1][1]sovereign stateCentral African EmpireThere have been \"ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign\" Empires.[2] An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire; and those created by sea-power, include territories which are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as the British Empire.[2] Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organisation controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses).[3] The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.[4]\n[2][2]Austro-Hungarian EmpireRussian EmpireBritish Empire[2][2]empiretransnational corporationpolitical boss[3][3]empireimperialismimperialismcolonialismcolonialismglobalizationglobalization[4][4]Contents\n\n1 Definition\n2 Characteristics\n3 History of imperialism\n\n3.1 Bronze and Iron Age empires\n3.2 Classical period\n3.3 Post-classical period\n3.4 Colonial empires\n3.5 Modern period\n3.6 Transition from empire\n\n\n4 Fall of empires\n\n4.1 Roman Empire\n\n\n5 Contemporary usage\n\n5.1 European Union\n5.2 United States\n\n\n6 Timeline of empires\n7 Theoretical research\n\n7.1 The Seven Stages of Empire\n7.2 Empire versus nation state\n7.3 Universal empire\n7.4 Circumscription theory\n7.5 Present\n7.6 Future\n\n\n8 See also\n\n8.1 Lists\n\n\n9 References\n10 Cited sources and further reading\n11 External links\n\nContentsContents\n1 Definition\n2 Characteristics\n3 History of imperialism\n\n3.1 Bronze and Iron Age empires\n3.2 Classical period\n3.3 Post-classical period\n3.4 Colonial empires\n3.5 Modern period\n3.6 Transition from empire\n\n\n4 Fall of empires\n\n4.1 Roman Empire\n\n\n5 Contemporary usage\n\n5.1 European Union\n5.2 United States\n\n\n6 Timeline of empires\n7 Theoretical research\n\n7.1 The Seven Stages of Empire\n7.2 Empire versus nation state\n7.3 Universal empire\n7.4 Circumscription theory\n7.5 Present\n7.6 Future\n\n\n8 See also\n\n8.1 Lists\n\n\n9 References\n10 Cited sources and further reading\n11 External links\n1 Definition1 Definition1Definition2 Characteristics2 Characteristics2Characteristics3 History of imperialism\n\n3.1 Bronze and Iron Age empires\n3.2 Classical period\n3.3 Post-classical period\n3.4 Colonial empires\n3.5 Modern period\n3.6 Transition from empire\n\n3 History of imperialism3History of imperialism\n3.1 Bronze and Iron Age empires\n3.2 Classical period\n3.3 Post-classical period\n3.4 Colonial empires\n3.5 Modern period\n3.6 Transition from empire\n3.1 Bronze and Iron Age empires3.1 Bronze and Iron Age empires3.1Bronze and Iron Age empires3.2 Classical period3.2 Classical period3.2Classical period3.3 Post-classical period3.3 Post-classical period3.3Post-classical period3.4 Colonial empires3.4 Colonial empires3.4Colonial empires3.5 Modern period3.5 Modern period3.5Modern period3.6 Transition from empire3.6 Transition from empire3.6Transition from empire4 Fall of empires\n\n4.1 Roman Empire\n\n4 Fall of empires4Fall of empires\n4.1 Roman Empire\n4.1 Roman Empire4.1 Roman Empire4.1Roman Empire5 Contemporary usage\n\n5.1 European Union\n5.2 United States\n\n5 Contemporary usage5Contemporary usage\n5.1 European Union\n5.2 United States\n5.1 European Union5.1 European Union5.1European Union5.2 United States5.2 United States5.2United States6 Timeline of empires6 Timeline of empires6Timeline of empires7 Theoretical research\n\n7.1 The Seven Stages of Empire\n7.2 Empire versus nation state\n7.3 Universal empire\n7.4 Circumscription theory\n7.5 Present\n7.6 Future\n\n7 Theoretical research7Theoretical research\n7.1 The Seven Stages of Empire\n7.2 Empire versus nation state\n7.3 Universal empire\n7.4 Circumscription theory\n7.5 Present\n7.6 Future\n7.1 The Seven Stages of Empire7.1 The Seven Stages of Empire7.1The Seven Stages of Empire7.2 Empire versus nation state7.2 Empire versus nation state7.2Empire versus nation state7.3 Universal empire7.3 Universal empire7.3Universal empire7.4 Circumscription theory7.4 Circumscription theory7.4Circumscription theory7.5 Present7.5 Present7.5Present7.6 Future7.6 Future7.6Future8 See also\n\n8.1 Lists\n\n8 See also8See also\n8.1 Lists\n8.1 Lists8.1 Lists8.1Lists9 References9 References9References10 Cited sources and further reading10 Cited sources and further reading10Cited sources and further reading11 External links11 External links11External linksDefinition[edit]Definition[edit][edit]An empire is an aggregate of many separate states or territories under a supreme ruler or oligarchy.[5] This is in contrast to a federation, which is an extensive state voluntarily composed of autonomous states and peoples. An empire is a large polity which rules over territories outside of its original borders.\n[5][5]federationDefinitions of what physically and politically constitute an empire vary. It might be a state affecting imperial policies or a particular political structure. Empires are typically formed from diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious components.[6] 'Empire' and 'colonialism' are used to refer to relationships between a powerful state or society versus a less powerful one; Michael W. Doyle has defined empire as \"effective control, whether formal or informal, of a subordinated society by an imperial society\".[7]\nimperial policiespolitical structure[6][6]Michael W. Doyle[7][7]Tom Nairn and Paul James define empires as polities that \"extend relations of power across territorial spaces over which they have no prior or given legal sovereignty, and where, in one or more of the domains of economics, politics, and culture, they gain some measure of extensive hegemony over those spaces for the purpose of extracting or accruing value\".[8] Rein Taagepera has defined an empire as \"any relatively large sovereign political entity whose components are not sovereign\".[9]\nTom NairnPaul James[8][8]Rein Taagepera[9][9]The terrestrial empire's maritime analogue is the thalassocracy, an empire composed of islands and coasts which are accessible to its terrestrial homeland, such as the Athenian-dominated Delian League.\nthalassocracyDelian LeagueFurthermore, empires can expand by both land and sea. Stephen Howe notes that empires by land can be characterized by expansion over terrain, \"extending directly outwards from the original frontier\"[6] while an empire by sea can be characterized by colonial expansion and empire building \"by an increasingly powerful navy\".[10]\n[6][6][10][10]However, sometimes an empire is only a semantic construction, such as when a ruler assumes the title of \"emperor\".[11][12][13][14] That polity over which the ruler reigns logically becomes an \"empire\", despite having no additional territory or hegemony. Examples of this form of empire are the Central African Empire, Mexican Empire, or the Korean Empire proclaimed in 1897 when Korea, far from gaining new territory, was on the verge of being annexed by the Empire of Japan, one of the last to use the name officially. Among the last states in the 20th century known as empires in this sense were the Central African Empire, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Manchukuo, Russia, Germany, and Korea.\n[11][11][12][12][13][13][14][14]Central African EmpireMexican EmpireKorean EmpireEmpire of JapanCentral African EmpireEthiopiaVietnamManchukuoRussiaGermanyKoreaScholars distinguish empires from nation-states.[15][16][17] In an empire, there is a hierarchy whereby one group of people (usually, the metropole) has command over other groups of people, and there is a hierarchy of rights and prestige for different groups of people.[18] Josep Colomer distinguished between empires and nation-states in the following way:\n[15][15][16][16][17][17][18][18]Josep ColomerEmpires were vastly larger than states\nEmpires lacked fixed or permanent boundaries whereas a state had fixed boundaries\nEmpires had a \"compound of diverse groups and territorial units with asymmetric links with the center\" whereas a state had \"supreme authority over a territory and population\"\nEmpires had multi-level, overlapping jurisdictions whereas a state sought monopoly and homogenization[16]Empires were vastly larger than statesEmpires lacked fixed or permanent boundaries whereas a state had fixed boundariesEmpires had a \"compound of diverse groups and territorial units with asymmetric links with the center\" whereas a state had \"supreme authority over a territory and population\"Empires had multi-level, overlapping jurisdictions whereas a state sought monopoly and homogenization[16][16][16]Characteristics[edit]Characteristics[edit][edit]Empires originated as different types of states, although they commonly began as powerful monarchies. Ideas about empires have changed over time, ranging from public approval to universal distaste. Empires are built out of separate units with some kind of diversity \u2013 ethnic, national, cultural, religious \u2013 and imply at least some inequality between the rulers and the ruled. Without this inequality, the system would be seen as a commonwealth. Throughout history, the major powers of the world constantly seek to conquer other parts of the world. Imperialism is the idea of a major power controlling another nation or land with the intentions to use the native people and resources to help the mother country in any way possible. Many empires were the result of military conquest, incorporating the vanquished states into a political union, but imperial hegemony can be established in other ways. The Athenian Empire, the Roman Empire, and the British Empire developed at least in part under elective auspices. The Empire of Brazil declared itself an empire after separating from the Portuguese Empire in 1822. France has twice transitioned from being called the French Republic to being called the French Empire while it retained an overseas empire.[19]\ncommonwealthImperialismAthenian EmpireRoman EmpireBritish EmpireelectiveEmpire of BrazilPortuguese EmpireFrench Republic[19][19] Diachronic map of the main empires of the modern era (1492\u20131945). Diachronic map of the main empires of the modern era (1492\u20131945).Diachronic map of the main empires of the modern era (1492\u20131945).Europeans began applying the designation of \"empire\" to non-European monarchies, such as the Qing Empire and the Mughal Empire, as well as the Maratha Empire, eventually leading to the looser denotations applicable to any political structure meeting the criteria of \"imperium\". Some monarchies styled themselves as having greater size, scope, and power than the territorial, politico-military, and economic facts support. As a consequence, some monarchs assumed the title of \"emperor\" (or its corresponding translation, tsar, empereur, kaiser, shah etc.) and renamed their states as \"The Empire of ...\". Empires were seen as an expanding power, administration, ideas and beliefs followed by cultural habits from place to place. Empires tend to impose their culture on the subject states to strengthen the imperial structure. This can have notable effects that outlast the empire itself, both positive and negative. Most histories of empires have been hostile, especially if the authors were promoting nationalism. Stephen Howe, although himself hostile, listed positive qualities: the guaranteed stability, security, and legal order for their subjects. They tried to minimize ethnic and religious antagonism inside the empire. The aristocracies that ruled them were often more cosmopolitan and broad-minded than their nationalistic successors.[20]\nQing EmpireMughal EmpireMaratha Empiretsartsarempereurkaiserkaisershahshah[20][20]There are two main ways to establish and maintain an imperial political structure: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion.[21] Territorial empires (e.g. the Macedonian Empire and Byzantine Empire) tend to be contiguous areas. The term, on occasion, has been applied to maritime republics or thalassocracies (e.g. the Athenian and British empires) with looser structures and more scattered territories, often consisting of many islands and other forms of possessions which required the creation and maintenance of a powerful navy. Empires such as the Holy Roman Empire also came together by electing the emperor with votes from member realms through the Imperial election.\npolitical structurehegemonic[21][21]Macedonian EmpireByzantine Empirecontiguousmaritime republicsthalassocraciesAthenianBritish empiresHoly Roman EmpireImperial electionHistory of imperialism[edit]History of imperialism[edit][edit]Bronze and Iron Age empires[edit]Bronze and Iron Age empires[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .tmulti .multiimageinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle .thumbcaption{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow>.thumbcaption{text-align:center}}Early empiresAchaemenid Empire of Persia at its zenithMaurya Empire of India at its greatest extent under Ashoka the GreatEarly empiresAchaemenid Empire of Persia at its zenithMaurya Empire of India at its greatest extent under Ashoka the GreatEarly empiresEarly empiresAchaemenid Empire of Persia at its zenithMaurya Empire of India at its greatest extent under Ashoka the GreatAchaemenid Empire of Persia at its zenithAchaemenid Empire of Persia at its zenithAchaemenid EmpirePersiaMaurya Empire of India at its greatest extent under Ashoka the GreatMaurya Empire of India at its greatest extent under Ashoka the GreatMaurya EmpireIndiaAshoka the GreatStephen Howe writes that with the exception of the Roman, Chinese and \"perhaps ancient Egyptian states\"; early empires seldom survived the death of their founder and were usually limited in scope to conquest and collection of tribute, having little impact on the everyday lives of their subjects.[22]\n[22][22]The earliest known empire appeared in southern Egypt sometime around 3200 BC. Southern Egypt was divided by three kingdoms each centered on a powerful city. Hierapolis conquered the other two cities over two centuries, and later grew into the country of Egypt.[23] The Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad (24th century BC), was an early all-Mesopotamian empire. This imperial achievement was repeated by Hammurabi of Babylon in the 17th century BC. In the 15th century BC, the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, ruled by Thutmose III, was ancient Africa's major force upon incorporating Nubia and the ancient city-states of the Levant.\n[23][23]Akkadian EmpireSargon of AkkadHammurabiBabylonNew KingdomAncient EgyptThutmose IIIancient AfricaNubiaancient city-statesLevantCirca 1500 BC in China rose the Shang Empire which was succeeded by the Zhou Empire circa 1100 BC. Both surpassed in territory their contemporary Near Eastern empires. The Zhou Empire dissolved in 770 BC into feudal multi-state system which lasted for five and a half centuries until the universal conquest of Qin in 221 BC. The first empire comparable to Rome in organization was the Neo-Assyrian Empire (916\u2013612 BC). The Median Empire was the first empire within the territory of Persia. By the 6th century BC, after having allied with the Babylonians to defeat the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Medes were able to establish their own empire, which was the largest of its day and lasted for about sixty years.[23]\nShang EmpireZhouQinNeo-Assyrian EmpireMedian EmpirePersiaBabyloniansNeo-Assyrian Empire[23][23]Classical period[edit]Classical period[edit][edit]See also: Sino-Roman relationsSino-Roman relationsEmpires of the Classical periodRoman Empire under Trajan (98\u2013117).

It is considered the first great empire in history or the first \"world empire\".[25] It was overthrown and replaced by the short-lived empire of Alexander the Great. His Empire was succeeded by three Empires ruled by the Diadochi\u2014the Seleucid, Ptolemaic, and Macedonian, which, despite being independent, are called the \"Hellenistic Empire\" by virtue of their similarities in culture and administration.\nAxial Age[24][24]Achaemenid EmpireMesopotamiaEgyptGreeceThraceMiddle EastCentral AsiaIndia[25][25]Alexander the GreatDiadochiSeleucidPtolemaicMacedonianHellenisticMeanwhile, in the western Mediterranean the Empires of Carthage and Rome began their rise. Having decisively defeated Carthage in 202 BC, Rome defeated Macedonia in 200 BC and the Seleucids in 190\u2013189 BC to establish an all-Mediterranean Empire. The Seleucid Empire broke apart and its former eastern part was absorbed by the Parthian Empire. In 30 BC Rome annexed Ptolemaic Egypt.\nCarthageRomeParthian EmpireIn India during the Axial Age appeared the Maurya Empire\u2014a geographically extensive and powerful empire, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BC. The empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya through the help of Chanakya,[26] who rapidly expanded his power westward across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers following the withdrawal by Alexander the Great. By 320 BC, the Maurya Empire had fully occupied northwestern India as well as defeating and conquering the satraps left by Alexander. Under Emperor Asoka the Great, the Maurya Empire became the first Indian empire to conquer the whole Indian Peninsula \u2014 an achievement repeated only twice, by the Gupta and Mughal Empires. In the reign of Asoka Buddhism spread to become the dominant religion in many parts of the ancient India.[23]\nAxial AgeMaurya EmpireChandragupta MauryaChanakya[26][26]northwestern IndiasatrapsAsoka the GreatGuptaMughalBuddhism[23][23]In 221 BC, China became an empire when the State of Qin ended the chaotic Warring States period through its conquest of the other six states and proclaimed the Qin Empire (221\u2013207 BC). The Qin Empire is known for the construction of the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Army, as well as the standardization of currency, weights, measures and writing system. It laid the foundation for China's first golden age, the Han Empire (202 BC\u2013AD 9, AD 25\u2013220). The Han Empire expanded into Central Asia and established trade through the Silk Road. Confucianism was, for the first time, adopted as an official state ideology. During the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han, the Xiongnu were pacified. By this time, only four empires stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic: the Han Empire of China, the Kushan Empire, the Parthian Empire of Persia, and the Roman Empire. The collapse of the Han Empire in AD 220 saw China fragmented into the Three Kingdoms, only to be unified once again by the Jin Empire (AD 266\u2013420). The relative weakness of the Jin Empire plunged China into political disunity that would last from AD 304 to AD 589 when the Sui Empire (AD 581\u2013618) reunited China.[23]\nState of QinWarring States periodconquestother six statesQin EmpireGreat Wall of ChinaTerracotta ArmyHan Empireexpanded into Central AsiaSilk RoadConfucianismEmperor Wu of HanXiongnuPacificAtlanticKushan EmpireParthian EmpireRoman Empirecollapse of the Han EmpireThree KingdomsJin EmpireSui Empire[23][23] Map showing the four empires of Eurasia in the 2nd century AD Map showing the four empires of Eurasia in the 2nd century ADMap showing the four empires of Eurasia in the 2nd century ADThe Romans were the first people to invent and embody the concept of empire in their two mandates: to wage war and to make and execute laws.[4] They were the most extensive Western empire until the early modern period, and left a lasting impact on European society. Many languages, cultural values, religious institutions, political divisions, urban centers, and legal systems can trace their origins to the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire governed and rested on exploitative actions. They took slaves and money from the peripheries to support the imperial center.[4] However, the absolute reliance on conquered peoples to carry out the empire's fortune, sustain wealth, and fight wars would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Roman Empire.[4] The Romans were strong believers in what they called their \"civilizing mission\". This term was legitimized and justified by writers like Cicero who wrote that only under Roman rule could the world flourish and prosper.[4] This ideology, that was envisioned to bring a new world order, was eventually spread across the Mediterranean world and beyond. People started to build houses like Romans, eat the same food, wear the same clothes and engage in the same games.[4] Even rights of citizenship and authority to rule were granted to people not born within Roman territory.[4]\n[4][4]early modern period[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4]The Latin word imperium, referring to a magistrate's power to command, gradually assumed the meaning \"The territory in which a magistrate can effectively enforce his commands\", while the term \"imperator\" was originally an honorific meaning \"commander\". The title was given to generals who were victorious in battle. Thus, an \"empire\" may include regions that are not legally within the territory of a state, but are under either direct or indirect control of that state, such as a colony, client state, or protectorate. Although historians use the terms \"Republican Period\" and \"Imperial Period\" to identify the periods of Roman history before and after absolute power was assumed by Augustus, the Romans themselves continued to refer to their government as a republic, and during the Republican Period, the territories controlled by the republic were referred to as \"Imperium Romanum\". The emperor's actual legal power derived from holding the office of \"consul\", but he was traditionally honored with the titles of imperator (commander) and princeps (first man or, chief). Later, these terms came to have legal significance in their own right; an army calling their general \"imperator\" was a direct challenge to the authority of the current emperor.[27]\nimperiumimperiumimperatorcolonyclient stateprotectorateAugustusImperium Romanumimperatorprincepsimperator[27][27]The legal systems of France and its former colonies are strongly influenced by Roman law.[28] Similarly, the United States was founded on a model inspired by the Roman Republic, with upper and lower legislative assemblies, and executive power vested in a single individual, the president. The president, as \"commander-in-chief\" of the armed forces, reflects the ancient Roman titles imperator princeps.[29] The Roman Catholic Church, founded in the early Imperial Period, spread across Europe, first by the activities of Christian evangelists, and later by official imperial promulgation.\nFrance[28][28]Roman Republicimperator princeps[29][29]Roman Catholic ChurchPost-classical period[edit]Post-classical period[edit][edit]Empires of the Post-classical periodEastern Roman Empire in 555.The expansion of the Rashidun Empire.The Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire and the Western Xia Empire of China in 1111.The territory directly held by the Tang Empire of China and its sphere of influence.Mongol Empire in the 13th century.Serbian Empire in 1350Almohad Empire 1147 \u2013 1269Bulgarian Empire in 850Empires of the Post-classical periodEastern Roman Empire in 555.The expansion of the Rashidun Empire.The Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire and the Western Xia Empire of China in 1111.The territory directly held by the Tang Empire of China and its sphere of influence.Mongol Empire in the 13th century.Serbian Empire in 1350Almohad Empire 1147 \u2013 1269Bulgarian Empire in 850Empires of the Post-classical periodEmpires of the Post-classical periodEastern Roman Empire in 555.The expansion of the Rashidun Empire.Eastern Roman Empire in 555.Eastern Roman Empire in 555.Eastern Roman EmpireThe expansion of the Rashidun Empire.The expansion of the Rashidun Empire.Rashidun EmpireThe Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire and the Western Xia Empire of China in 1111.The territory directly held by the Tang Empire of China and its sphere of influence.The Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire and the Western Xia Empire of China in 1111.The Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire and the Western Xia Empire of China in 1111.Great Liao EmpireSong EmpireWestern Xia EmpireThe territory directly held by the Tang Empire of China and its sphere of influence.The territory directly held by the Tang Empire of China and its sphere of influence.Tang EmpireMongol Empire in the 13th century.Serbian Empire in 1350Mongol Empire in the 13th century.Mongol Empire in the 13th century.Mongol EmpireSerbian Empire in 1350Serbian Empire in 1350Serbian EmpireAlmohad Empire 1147 \u2013 1269Bulgarian Empire in 850Almohad Empire 1147 \u2013 1269Almohad Empire 1147 \u2013 1269Almohad EmpireBulgarian Empire in 850Bulgarian Empire in 850Bulgarian EmpireIn Western Asia, the term \"Persian Empire\" came to denote the Iranian imperial states established at different historical periods of pre\u2013Islamic and post\u2013Islamic Persia.[23]\nWestern AsiaPersian EmpireIranianIslamicPersia[23][23]In East Asia, various Chinese empires dominated the political, economic and cultural landscapes during this era, the most powerful of which was probably the Tang Empire (618\u2013690, 705\u2013907). Other influential Chinese empires during the post-classical period include the Sui Empire (581\u2013618), the Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire, the Western Xia Empire (1038\u20131227), the Great Jin Empire (1115\u20131234), the Western Liao Empire (1124\u20131218), the Great Yuan Empire (1271\u20131368), and the Great Ming Empire (1368\u20131644). During this period, Japan and Korea underwent voluntary Sinicization.[30][31][32] The Sui, Tang and Song empires had the world's largest economy and were the most technologically advanced during their time;[33][34] the Great Yuan Empire was the world's ninth largest empire by total land area; while the Great Ming Empire is famous for the seven maritime expeditions led by Zheng He.[23]\nEast AsiaTang EmpireSui EmpireGreat Liao EmpireSong EmpireWestern Xia EmpireGreat Jin EmpireWestern Liao EmpireGreat Yuan EmpireGreat Ming EmpireSinicization[30][30][31][31][32][32][33][33][34][34]ninth largest empireseven maritime expeditionsZheng He[23][23]The Ajuran Sultanate was a Somali empire in the medieval times that dominated the Indian Ocean trade. They belonged to the Somali Muslim sultanate[35][36][37] that ruled over large parts of the Horn of Africa in the Middle Ages. Through a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the Ajuran Sultanate successfully resisted an Oromo invasion from the west and a Portuguese incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of Somali maritime enterprise were strengthened or re-established, and foreign trade and commerce in the coastal provinces flourished with ships sailing to and coming from many kingdoms and empires in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and East Africa.[38]\nAjuran SultanateSomaliIndian OceanSomaliMuslimsultanate[35][35][36][36][37][37]Horn of AfricaMiddle AgesOromoinvasionPortugueseAjuran-Portuguese warsSomali maritime enterpriseEast AsiaSouth AsiaSoutheast AsiaEuropeMiddle EastNorth AfricaEast Africa[38][38]In the 7th century, Maritime Southeast Asia witnessed the rise of a Buddhist thallasocracy, the Srivijaya Empire, which thrived for 600 years and was succeeded by the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire that ruled from the 13th to 15th centuries. In the Southeast Asian mainland, the Hindu-Buddhist Khmer Empire was centered in the city of Angkor and flourished from the 9th to 13th centuries. Following the demise of the Khmer Empire, the Siamese Empire flourished alongside the Burmese and Lan Chang Empires from the 13th through the 18th centuries.\nMaritime Southeast AsiaBuddhistSrivijaya EmpireMajapahit EmpireKhmer EmpireAngkorIn Southeastern and Eastern Europe, during 917, the Eastern Roman Empire, sometimes called the Byzantine Empire, was forced to recognize the Imperial title of Bulgarian ruler Simeon the Great, who were then called Tsar, the first ruler to hold that precise imperial title. The Bulgarian Empire, established in the region in 680-681, remained a major power in Southeast Europe until its fall in the late 14th century. Bulgaria gradually reached its cultural and territorial apogee in the 9th century and early 10th century under Prince Boris I and Simeon I, when its early Christianization in 864 allowed it to develop into the cultural and literary center of Slavic Europe, as well as one of the largest states in Europe, thus the period is considered the Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture. Major events included the development of the Cyrillic script at the Preslav Literary School, declared official in 893, and the establishment of the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian.[39][40][41]\nSoutheasternEastern EuropeEastern Roman EmpireBulgarianSimeon the GreatTsarBulgarian EmpireSoutheast EuropePrince Boris IChristianizationSlavic EuropeGolden Age of medieval Bulgarian cultureCyrillic scriptPreslav Literary SchoolOld Church SlavonicOld Bulgarian[39][39][40][40][41][41]At the time, in the Medieval West, the title \"empire\" had a specific technical meaning that was exclusively applied to states that considered themselves the heirs and successors of the Roman Empire. Among these were the \"Byzantine Empire\", which was the actual continuation of the Eastern portion of the Roman Empire, the Carolingian Empire, the largely Germanic Holy Roman Empire, and the Russian Empire. Yet, these states did not always fit the geographic, political, or military profiles of empires in the modern sense of the word. To legitimise their imperium, these states directly claimed the title of Empire from Rome. The sacrum Romanum imperium (Holy Roman Empire), which lasted from 800 to 1806, claimed to have exclusively comprehended Christian principalities, and was only nominally a discrete imperial state. The Holy Roman Empire was not always centrally-governed, as it had neither core nor peripheral territories, and was not governed by a central, politico-military elite. Hence, Voltaire's remark that the Holy Roman Empire \"was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire\" is accurate to the degree that it ignores[42] German rule over Italian, French, Proven\u00e7al, Polish, Flemish, Dutch, and Bohemian populations, and the efforts of the ninth-century Holy Roman Emperors (i.e., the Ottonians) to establish central control. Voltaire's \"nor an empire\" observation applies to its late period.\nMedieval WestEastern portion of the Roman EmpireCarolingian EmpireHoly Roman EmpireRussian EmpireimperiumEmpiresacrum Romanum imperiumVoltaire[42][42]Holy Roman EmperorsOttoniansIn 1204, after the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople, the crusaders established a Latin Empire (1204\u20131261) in that city, while the defeated Byzantine Empire's descendants established two smaller, short-lived empires in Asia Minor: the Empire of Nicaea (1204\u20131261) and the Empire of Trebizond (1204\u20131461).\nConstantinople was retaken in 1261 by the Byzantine successor state centered in Nicaea, re-establishing the Byzantine Empire until 1453, by which time the Turkish-Muslim Ottoman Empire (ca. 1300\u20131918), had conquered most of the region. The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire and it was the most powerful empire to succeed the Abbasi empires at the time, as well as one of the most powerful empires in the world.[43] They became the successors after the Abbasid Empire fell from the Mongols (H\u00fcleg\u00fc Khan). The Ottoman Empire centered on modern day Turkey, dominated the eastern Mediterranean, overthrew the Byzantine Empire to claim Constantinople and it would start battering at Austria and Malta, which were countries that were key to central and to south-west Europe respectively \u2014 mainly for their geographical location.[43] The reason these occurrences of batterings were so important was because the Ottomans were Muslim, and the rest of Europe was Christian, so there was a sense of religious fighting going on.[43] This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims.[43] Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries, and they had problems in them as well.[43] The flows of trade and of cultural influences across the supposed great divide never ceased, so the countries never stopped bartering with each other.[4] These epochal clashes between civilizations profoundly shaped many people's thinking back then, and continues to do so in the present day.[1] Modern hatred against Muslim communities in South-Eastern Europe, mainly in Bosnia and Kosovo, has often been articulated in terms of seeing them as unwelcome residues of this imperialism: in short, as Turks.[44] Moreover, Eastern Orthodox imperialism was not re-established until the coronation of Ivan the Terrible as Emperor of Russia in 1547. Likewise, with the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars (1803\u20131815), the Austrian Empire (1804\u20131867) emerged reconstituted as the Empire of Austria-Hungary (1867\u20131918), having \"inherited\" the imperium of Central and Western Europe from the losers of said wars.\nFourth CrusadeConstantinoplecrusadersLatin EmpireAsia MinorEmpire of NicaeaEmpire of TrebizondNicaeaByzantine EmpireTurkishMuslimOttoman Empire[43][43][43][43][43][43][43][43][43][43][4][4][1][1][44][44]Ivan the TerribleEmperor of RussiaNapoleonic WarsAustrian EmpireAustria-HungaryIn the thirteenth century, Genghis Khan expanded the Mongol Empire to be the largest contiguous empire in the world. However, within two generations, the empire was separated into four discrete khanates under Genghis Khan's grandsons. One of them, Kublai Khan, conquered China and established the Yuan dynasty with the imperial capital at Beijing. One family ruled the whole Eurasian land mass from the Pacific to the Adriatic and Baltic Seas. The emergence of the Pax Mongolica had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia. The Safavid Empire of Iran was also founded.\n[45][46]\nGenghis KhanMongol EmpireKublai KhanYuan dynastyBeijingPax MongolicatradecommerceSafavid EmpireIran[45][45][46][46]The Islamic gunpowder empires started to develop from the 15th century.[47]\ngunpowder empires[47][47]In the Indian subcontinent, the Delhi Sultanate conquered most of the Indian peninsula and spread Islam across it.

His successors such Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan extended the empire. Meanwhile, the Sur Empire was also established in the north by Sher Shah Suri.\nIn the 17th century, Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir expanded the Mughal Empire, controlling most of the South Asia through Sharia,[48][49] which became the world's largest economy and leading manufacturing power with a nominal GDP that valued a quarter of world GDP, superior than the combination of Europe's GDP.[50][51] It has been estimated that the Mughal emperors controlled an unprecedented one-fourth of the world's entire economy and was home to one-fourth of the world's population at the time.[52]\nIndian subcontinentDelhi SultanateIslamBengal SultanateMughal EmpireTimurGenghis KhanBaburHumayunAkbarJahangirShah JahanSur EmpireSher Shah SuriMuhammad Aurangzeb AlamgirMughal EmpireSouth AsiaSharia[48][48][49][49]Europe[50][50][51][51][52][52]After the death of Aurangzeb, which marks the end of the medieval India and the beginning of European invasion in India, the empire was weakened by Nader Shah's invasion.[53]\nNader Shah[53][53]The Mysore Empire was soon established by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, allies of Napoleone Bonaparte.[54][55][56] Other independent empires were also been established, such as those ruled by the Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad[57] and Hyderabad State's Nizam of Hyderabad.[58]\nMysore EmpireHyder AliTipu SultanNapoleone Bonaparte[54][54][55][55][56][56]Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad[57][57]Hyderabad StateNizam of Hyderabad[58][58]In the pre-Columbian Americas, two Empires were prominent\u2014the Azteca in Mesoamerica and Inca in Peru.

In the Old World, colonial imperialism was attempted and established on the Canary Islands and Ireland. These conquered lands and people became de jure subordinates of the empire, rather than de facto imperial territories and subjects. Such subjugation often elicited \"client-state\" resentment that the empire unwisely ignored, leading to the collapse of the European colonial imperial system in the late 19th through the mid-20th century. Portuguese discovery of Newfoundland in the New World gave way to many expeditions led by England (later Britain), Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. In the 18th century, the Spanish Empire was at its height because of the great mass of goods taken from conquered territory in the Americas (nowadays Mexico, parts of the United States, the Caribbean, most of Central America, and South America) and the Philippines.\nSpainNew WorldRenaissanceimperialismCanary IslandsIrelandde jurede jurede factode factoNewfoundlandEnglandBritainSpainFranceDutch RepublicSpanish EmpireMexicoUnited StatesCaribbeanPhilippinesModern period[edit]Modern period[edit][edit]Empires of the Modern periodRed shows self-governing North American British colonies and pink shows claimed and largely indirectly controlled territories in 1775.In 1690, the realms of the Mughal Empire spanned from Kabul in the west to Cape Comorin, Tamil Nadu in the south.[61]Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent.Spanish\u2013Portuguese Empire of the Iberian Union (1580\u20131640) was the first global imperial entity.

In 1776, the Continental Congress of the Thirteen Colonies declared itself independent from the British Empire, thus beginning the American Revolution. Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific, and later Africa, with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the Second British Empire (1783\u20131815), which was followed by the Industrial Revolution and Britain's Imperial Century (1815\u20131914). It became the largest empire in world history, encompassing one quarter of the world's land area and one fifth of its population.[62] The impacts of this period are still prominent in the current age \"including widespread use of the English language, belief in Protestant religion, economic globalization, modern precepts of law and order, and representative democracy.\"[63][64]\nfirst empireBritish AmericaCanadaCaribbeanThirteen ColoniesContinental CongressAmerican RevolutionSecond British EmpireIndustrial RevolutionBritain's Imperial Centurylargest empire[62][62][63][63][64][64]The Great Qing Empire of China (1636\u20131912) was the fifth largest empire in world history by total land area, and laid the foundation for the modern territorial claims of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China. Apart from having direct control over much of East Asia, the empire also exerted domination over other states through the Chinese tributary system. The multiethnic and multicultural nature of the Great Qing Empire was crucial to the subsequent birth of the nationalistic concept of zhonghua minzu. The empire reached its peak during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, after which the empire entered a period of prolonged decline, culminating in its collapse as a result of the Xinhai Revolution.\nGreat Qing Empirefifth largest empirePeople's Republic of ChinaRepublic of Chinaother statesChinese tributary systemzhonghua minzuzhonghua minzuQianlong EmperorXinhai RevolutionThe Ashanti Empire (or Confederacy), also Asanteman (1701\u20131896), was a West African state of the Ashanti, the Akan people of the Ashanti Region, Akanland in modern-day Ghana. The Ashanti (or Asante) were a powerful, militaristic and highly disciplined people in West Africa. Their military power, which came from effective strategy and an early adoption of European firearms, created an empire that stretched from central Akanland (in modern-day Ghana) to present day Benin and Ivory Coast, bordered by the Dagomba kingdom to the north and Dahomey to the east. Due to the empire's military prowess, sophisticated hierarchy, social stratification and culture, the Ashanti empire had one of the largest historiographies of any indigenous Sub-Saharan African political entity.\nAshanti EmpireWest AfricanAshantiAkan peopleAshanti RegionfirearmsBeninIvory CoastDagombaDahomeyhistoriographiesSub-Saharan AfricanThe Sikh Empire (1799\u20131846) was established in the Punjab region of India. The empire collapsed when its founder, Ranjit Singh, died and its army fell to the British. During the same period, the Maratha Empire (also known as the Maratha Confederacy) was a Hindu state located in present-day India. It existed from 1674 to 1818, and at its peak, the empire's territories covered much of Southern Asia. The empire was founded and consolidated by Shivaji. After the death of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, it expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat, which halted the expansion of the empire. Later, the empire was divided into a confederacy of states which, in 1818, were lost to the British during the Anglo-Maratha wars.[65]\nSikh EmpireMaratha EmpireMughalAnglo-Maratha wars[65][65]The French emperors Napoleon I and Napoleon III (See: Premier Empire, Second French Empire) each attempted establishing a western imperial hegemony centered in France. The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \"first colonial empire,\" that existed until 1814, and the \"second colonial empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second colonial empire came to an end after the decolonizations of Indochina (1954), Algeria (1962) and French Africa. At its apex, it was one of the largest empires in history; including metropolitan France, the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached 11,500,000 km2 (4,400,000 sq mi), with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\nNapoleon INapoleon IIIPremier EmpireSecond French EmpireFrench colonial empireFrench AfricaThe Empire of Brazil (1822\u20131889) was the only South American modern monarchy, established by the heir of the Portuguese Empire as an independent nation eventually became an emerging international power.

The term is most commonly used to describe the U.S.'s status since the 20th century, but it can also be applied to the United States' world standing before the rise of nationalism in the 20th century.[66] The United States is not traditionally recognized as an empire, in part because the U.S. adopted a different political system from those that previous empires had used. Despite these systematic differences, the political objectives and strategies of the United States government have been quite similar to those of previous empires.[67] Due to this similarity some scholars confess: \"When it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it's a duck.\"[68][69][70] Academic, Krishna Kumar, argues the distinct principles of nationalism and imperialism may result in common practice; that is, the pursuit of nationalism can often coincide with the pursuit of imperialism in terms of strategy and decision making.[71] Throughout the 19th century, the United States government attempted to expand its territory by any means necessary. Regardless of the supposed motivation for this constant expansion, all of these land acquisitions were carried out by imperialistic means. This was done by financial means in some cases, and by military force in others. Most notably, the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Texas Annexation (1845), and the Mexican Cession (1848) highlight the imperialistic goals of the United States during this \u201cmodern period\u201d of imperialism. The U.S. government has stopped adding additional territories, where they permanently and politically take over since the early 20th century, and instead have established 800 military bases as their outposts.[72] With this overt but subtile military control of other countries, scholars consider U.S. foreign policy strategies to be imperialistic.[73] This idea is explored in the \"contemporary usage\" section.\nAmerican Empirecultural ideologiesforeign policy[66][66][67][67][68][68][69][69][70][70][71][71]expand its territoryimperialistic means[72][72]U.S. foreign policy strategies[73][73]Transition from empire[edit]Transition from empire[edit][edit]In time, an empire may change from one political entity to another. For example, the Holy Roman Empire, a German re-constitution of the Roman Empire, metamorphosed into various political structures (i.e., federalism), and eventually, under Habsburg rule, re-constituted itself in 1804 as the Austrian Empire, an empire of much different politics and scope, which in turn became the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1867. The Roman Empire, perennially reborn, also lived on as the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) \u2013 temporarily splitting into the Latin Empire, the Empire of Nicaea and the Empire of Trebizond before its remaining territory and centre became part of the Ottoman Empire. A similarly persistent concept of empire saw the Mongol Empire become the Khanate of the Golden Horde, the Yuan Empire of China, and the Ilkhanate before resurrection as the Timurid Empire and as the Mughal Empire. After 1945 the Empire of Japan retained its Emperor but lost its colonial possessions and became the State of Japan.\nRoman EmpireHabsburgAustrian EmpireAustro-Hungarian EmpireByzantine EmpireLatin EmpireEmpire of NicaeaEmpire of TrebizondOttoman EmpireMongol EmpireGolden HordeYuanEmpire of ChinaIlkhanateTimurid EmpireMughal EmpireEmpire of JapanJapanAn autocratic empire can become a republic (e.g., the Central African Empire in 1979), or it can become a republic with its imperial dominions reduced to a core territory (e.g., Weimar Germany shorn of the German colonial empire (1918\u20131919), or the Ottoman Empire (1918\u20131923)). The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after 1918 provides an example of a multi-ethnic superstate broken into constituent nation-oriented states: the republics, kingdoms, and provinces of Austria, Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czechoslovakia, Ruthenia, Galicia, et al. In the aftermath of World War I the Russian Empire also broke up and became reduced to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) before re-forming as the USSR (1922\u20131991) \u2013 sometimes seen as the core of a Soviet Empire.\nrepublicWeimar GermanysuperstateAustriaHungaryTransylvaniaCroatiaSloveniaBosnia and HerzegovinaCzechoslovakiaRutheniaGaliciaet alWorld War IRussian EmpireRussian Soviet Federative Socialist RepublicSoviet EmpireAfter the Second World War (1939\u20131945), the deconstruction of colonial empires quickened and became commonly known as decolonisation. The British Empire evolved into a loose, multinational Commonwealth of Nations, while the French colonial empire metamorphosed to a Francophone commonwealth. The same process happened to the Portuguese Empire, which evolved into a Lusophone commonwealth, and to the former territories of the extinct Spanish Empire, which alongside the Lusophone countries of Portugal and Brazil, created an Ibero-American commowealth. France returned the French territory of Kwang-Chou-Wan to China in 1946. The British gave Hong Kong back to China in 1997 after 150 years of rule. The Portuguese territory of Macau reverted to China in 1999. Macau and Hong Kong did not become part of the provincial structure of China; they have autonomous systems of government as Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China.\ndecolonisationCommonwealth of NationsFrench colonial empireFrancophone commonwealthPortuguese EmpireLusophone commonwealthSpanish EmpirePortugalBrazilIbero-American commowealthKwang-Chou-WanHong KongMacauSpecial Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of ChinaFrance still governs overseas territories (French Guiana, Martinique, R\u00e9union, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Saint Martin, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, Guadeloupe, French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF), Wallis and Futuna, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, and Mayotte), and exerts hegemony in Francafrique (\"French Africa\"; 29 francophone countries such as Chad, Rwanda, etc.).

Cohen[74][74]Fall of empires[edit]Fall of empires[edit][edit]Roman Empire[edit]Roman Empire[edit][edit]Further information: Fall of the Western Roman EmpireFall of the Western Roman EmpireThe fall of the western half of the Roman Empire is seen as one of the most pivotal points in all of human history. This event traditionally marks the transition from classical civilization to the birth of Europe. The Roman Empire started to decline at the end of the reign of the last of the Five Good Emperors, Marcus Aurelius in 161\u2013180 A.D. There is still a debate over the cause of the fall of one of the largest empires in history. Piganiol argues that the Roman Empire under its authority can be described as \"a period of terror\",[75] holding its imperial system accountable for its failure. Another theory blames the rise of Christianity as the cause, arguing that the spread of certain Christian ideals caused internal weakness of the military and state.[76] In the book The Fall of the Roman Empire, by Peter Heather, he contends that there are many factors, including issues of money and manpower, which produce military limitations and culminate in the Roman army's inability to effectively repel invading barbarians at the frontier.[77] The Western Roman economy was already stretched to its limit in the 4th and 5th Centuries C.E. due to continual conflict and loss of territory which, in turn, generated loss of revenue from the tax base. There was also the looming presence of the Persians which, at any time, took a large percentage of the fighting force's attention. At the same time the Huns, a nomadic warrior people from the steppes of Asia, are also putting extreme pressure on the German tribes outside of the Roman frontier, which gave the German tribes no other choice, geographically, but to move into Roman territory. At this point, without increased funding, the Roman army could no longer effectively defend its borders against major waves of Germanic tribes. This inability is illustrated by the crushing defeat at Adrianople in 378 C.E. and, later, the Battle of Frigidus.\nwestern half of the Roman EmpireFive Good Emperors[75][75][76][76]The Fall of the Roman Empire[77][77]defeat at AdrianopleBattle of FrigidusContemporary usage[edit]Contemporary usage[edit][edit]Main article: ImperialismImperialismContemporaneously, the concept of empire is politically valid, yet is not always used in the traditional sense. Despite the semantic reference to imperial power, Japan is a de jure constitutional monarchy, with a homogeneous population of 127 million people that is 98.5 percent ethnic Japanese, making it one of the largest nation-states.[78]\nempirede jurede jureconstitutional monarchy[78][78]In his book review of Empire (2000) by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Mehmet Akif Okur posits that since the September 11 attacks in the United States, the international relations determining the world's balance of power (political, economic, military) have been altered. These alterations include the intellectual (political science) trends that perceive the contemporary world's order via the re-territorialization of political space, the re-emergence of classical imperialist practices (the \"inside\" vs. \"outside\" duality, cf. the Other), the deliberate weakening of international organizations, the restructured international economy, economic nationalism, the expanded arming of most countries, the proliferation of nuclear weapon capabilities and the politics of identity emphasizing a state's subjective perception of its place in the world, as a nation and as a civilization. These changes constitute the \"Age of Nation Empires\"; as imperial usage, nation-empire denotes the return of geopolitical power from global power blocs to regional power blocs (i.e., centered upon a \"regional power\" state [China, EU, Russia, US, et al.]) and regional multi-state power alliances (i.e., Mediterranean, Latin America, Southeast Asia). Nation-empire regionalism claims sovereignty over their respective (regional) political (social, economic, ideologic), cultural, and military spheres.[79]\nEmpireMichael HardtAntonio NegriSeptember 11 attackspolitical spaceclassical imperialist practicesOtherpolitics of identitysubjectivenation-empireglobalregionalet al[79][79]European Union[edit]European Union[edit][edit]Since the European Union was formed as a polity in 1993, it has established its own currency, its own citizenship, established discrete military forces, and exercises its limited hegemony in the Mediterranean, eastern parts of Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. The big size and high development index of the EU economy often has the ability to influence global trade regulations in its favor. The political scientist Jan Zielonka suggests that this behavior is imperial because it coerces its neighbouring countries into adopting its European economic, legal, and political structures.[80][81][82][83][84][85] Tony Benn, a left-wing Labour Party MP of the United Kingdom, opposed the European integration policies of the European Union by saying, \"I think they're (the European Union) building an empire there, they want us (the United Kingdom) to be a part of their empire and I don't want that.\"[86]\nEuropean Unioncitizenshipmilitary forcesEU economyability to influenceJan ZielonkaEuropean[80][80][81][81][82][82][83][83][84][84][85][85]Tony BennLabour PartyEuropean integration[86][86]United States[edit]United States[edit][edit]The neutrality of this article is disputed.

The controversy stems in part from the fact the US itself was at one point a colony in the British Empire. However, founding fathers such as George Washington noted after the Revolution that the US was an empire in its Infancy, and others like Thomas Jefferson agreed, describing the constitution as the perfect foundation for an \u201cextensive Empire\u201d.[citation needed] Even so, the false ideology that the US was founded on Anti-Imperialist principles has prevented many from acknowledging America's status as an empire. This active rejection of imperialist status is not limited to high-ranking government officials, as it has been ingrained in American society throughout its entire history. As David Ludden explains, \"journalists, scholars, teachers, students, analysts, and politicians prefer to depict the U.S. as a nation pursuing its own interests and ideals\".[87] This often results in imperialist endeavors being presented as measures taken to enhance state security. Ludden explains this phenomenon with the concept of \"ideological blinders\", which he says prevent American citizens from realizing the true nature of America's current systems and strategies. These \"ideological blinders\" that people wear have resulted in an \"invisible\" American empire of which most American citizens are unaware.[87]\nterritorial expansionAmerican Empire[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation needed[87][87][87][87]Stuart Creighton Miller posits that the public's sense of innocence about Realpolitik (cf. American exceptionalism) impairs popular recognition of US imperial conduct since it governed other countries via surrogates. These surrogates were domestically-weak, right-wing governments that would collapse without US support.[88] Former President G. W. Bush's Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, said: \"We don't seek empires. We're not imperialistic; we never have been.\"[89] This statement directly contradicts Thomas Jefferson who, in the 1780s while awaiting the fall of the Spanish empire, said: \"till our population can be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them piece by piece\".[90][91][92] In turn, historian Sidney Lens argues that from its inception, the US has used every means available to dominate foreign peoples and states.[93]\nAmerican exceptionalism[88][88]Donald Rumsfeld[89][89][90][90][91][91][92][92]Sidney Lens[93][93]Timeline of empires[edit]Timeline of empires[edit][edit]This section does not cite any sources.

His seventh law stated: \"The general trend toward amalgamation transmits the tendency of territorial growth from state to state and increases the tendency in the process of transmission.\" He commented on this law to make its meaning clear: \"There is on this small planet sufficient space for only one great state.\"[117]\nFriedrich Ratzel[116][116][117][117]Two other contemporaries\u2014Kang Yu-wei and George Vacher de Lapouge\u2014stressed that imperial expansion cannot indefinitely proceed on the definite surface of the globe and therefore world empire is imminent. Kang Yu-wei in 1885 believed that the imperial trend will culminate in the contest between Washington and Berlin[118] and Vacher de Lapouge in 1899 estimated that the final contest will be between Russia and America in which America is likely to triumph.[119]\nKang Yu-weiVacher de Lapouge[118][118][119][119]The above envisaged contests indeed took place, known to us as World War I and II.

Einstein believed that, unless world government is established by agreement, an imperial world government would come by war or wars.[124] Russell expected a third World War to result in a world government under the empire of the United States.[125] Three years later, another prominent pacifist, Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, generalized on the ancient Empires of Egypt, Babylon, Persia and Greece to imply for the modern world: \"The analogy in present global terms would be the final unification of the world through the preponderant power of either America or Russia, whichever proved herself victorious in the final struggle.\"[126]\nAlbert EinsteinBertrand Russellworld government[124][124]third World War[125][125]Reinhold Niebuhr[126][126]Russian colleague of Russell and Neighbour, Georgy Fedotov, wrote in 1945: All empires are but stages on the way to the sole Empire which must swallow all others. The only question is who will build it and on which foundations. Universal unity is the only alternative to annihilation. Unity by conference is utopian but unity by conquest by the strongest Power is not and probably the uncompleted in this War will be completed in the next. \"Pax Atlantica\" is the best of possible outcomes.[127]\nGeorgy Fedotov[127][127]Originally drafted as a secret study for the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor of the CIA) in 1944[128] and published as a book three years later, The Struggle for the World... by James Burnham concludes: If either of the two Superpowers wins, the result would be a universal empire which in our case would also be a world empire. The historical stage for a world empire had already been set prior to and independently of the discovery of atomic weapons but these weapons make a world empire inevitable and imminent. \"The atomic weapons ... will not permit the world to wait.\" Only a world empire can establish monopoly on atomic weapons and thus guarantee the survival of civilization. A world empire \"is in fact the objective of the Third World War which, in its preliminary stages, has already began\". The issue of a world empire \"will be decided, and in our day. In the course of the decision, both of the present antagonists may, it is true, be destroyed, but one of them must be.\"[129] In 1951, Hans Morgenthau concluded that the \"best\" outcome of World War III would be world empire:\nOffice of Strategic ServicesCIA[128][128]The Struggle for the World...James Burnham[129][129]Hans Morgenthau\nToday war has become an instrument of universal destruction, an instrument that destroys the victor and the vanquished ...

Correspondingly, these are the three most circumscribed civilizations in human history. The Empires of Egypt (established by Narmer c. 3000 BC) and China (established by Cheng in 221 BC) endured for over two millennia. German Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck, criticizing the Western idea of progress, emphasized that China and Egypt remained at one particular stage of development for millennia. This stage was universal empire. The development of Egypt and China came to a halt once their empires \"reached the limits of their natural habitat\".[140] Sinology does not recognize the Eurocentric view of the \"inevitable\" imperial fall;[141][142] Egyptology[143][144] and Japanology pose equal challenges.\nRobert Carneiro[136][136][137][137][138][138][139][139]JapanNarmerCheng[140][140]Sinology[141][141][142][142][143][143][144][144]JapanologyCarneiro explored the Bronze Age civilizations.

They conclude: The \"rigidity of the borders\" contributed importantly to hegemony in every concerned case.[145] Hence, \"when the system's borders are rigid, the probability of hegemony is high\".[146]\nWilliam Wohlforth[145][145][146][146]The circumscription theory was stressed in the comparative studies of the Roman and Chinese Empires. The circumscribed Chinese Empire recovered from all falls, while the fall of Rome, by contrast, was fatal. \"What counteracted this [imperial] tendency in Europe ... was a countervailing tendency for the geographical boundaries of the system to expand.\" If \"Europe had been a closed system, some great power would eventually have succeeded in establishing absolute supremacy over the other states in the region\".[147]\ncomparative studies of the Roman and Chinese Empires[147][147]\nThe ancient Chinese system was relatively enclosed, whereas the European system began to expand its reach to the rest of the world from the onset of system formation\u2026 In addition, overseas provided outlet for territorial competition, thereby allowing international competition on the European continent to ... trump the ongoing pressure toward convergence.[148]\nThe ancient Chinese system was relatively enclosed, whereas the European system began to expand its reach to the rest of the world from the onset of system formation\u2026 In addition, overseas provided outlet for territorial competition, thereby allowing international competition on the European continent to ... trump the ongoing pressure toward convergence.[148][148][148]In the 1945 book, The Precarious Balance, on four centuries of the European power struggle, Ludwig Dehio explained the durability of the European states system by its overseas expansion: \"Overseas expansion and the system of states were born at the same time; the vitality that burst the bounds of the Western world also destroyed its unity.\"[149] Edward Carr causally linked the end of the overseas outlet for imperial expansion and World Wars. In the nineteenth century, he wrote during the Second World War, imperialist wars were waged against \"primitive\" peoples. \"It was silly for European countries to fight against one another when they could still ... maintain social cohesion by continuous expansion in Asia and Africa. Since 1900, however, this has no longer been possible: \"the situation has radically changed\". Now wars are between \"imperial powers.\"[150] Hans Morgenthau wrote that the very imperial expansion into relatively empty geographical spaces in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries, in Africa, Eurasia, and western North America, deflected great power politics into the periphery of the earth, thereby reducing conflict. For example, the more attention Russia, France and the United States paid to expanding into far-flung territories in imperial fashion, the less attention they paid to one another, and the more peaceful, in a sense, the world was. But by the late nineteenth century, the consolidation of the great nation-states and empires of the West was consummated, and territorial gains could only be made at the expense of one another.[151] John H. Herz outlined one \"chief function\" of the overseas expansion and the impact of its end:\nThe Precarious BalanceLudwig Dehio[149][149]Edward Carr[150][150]Hans Morgenthau[151][151]John H. Herz\n[A] European balance of power could be maintained or adjusted because it was relatively easy to divert European conflicts into overseas directions and adjust them there. Thus the openness of the world contributed to the consolidation of the territorial system. The end of the 'world frontier' and the resulting closedness of an interdependent world inevitably affected the system's effectiveness.[152]\n[A] European balance of power could be maintained or adjusted because it was relatively easy to divert European conflicts into overseas directions and adjust them there.

The unexplored and unclaimed \"blank\" spaces on the world map were rapidly diminishing ... and the sense of \"global closure\" prompted an anxious fin-de-si\u00e8cle debate about the future of the great empires ...

Far from being impossible or exceedingly improbable, systemic hegemony is likely under two conditions: \"when the boundaries of the international system remain stable and no new major powers emerge from outside the system.\"[154] With the system becoming global, further expansion is precluded. The geopolitical condition of \"global closure\"[155] will remain to the end of history. Since \"the contemporary international system is global, we can rule out the possibility that geographic expansion of the system will contribute to the emergence of a new balance of power, as it did so many times in the past.\"[156] As Quincy Wright had put it, \"this process can no longer continue without interplanetary wars.\"[157]\n[154][154][155][155][156][156]Quincy Wright[157][157]One of leading experts on world-system theory, Christopher Chase-Dunn, noted that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system, since the global system is circumscribed.[158][159] In fact, within less than a century of its circumscribed existence the global system overcame the centuries-old balance of power and reached the unipolarity. Given \"constant spatial parameters\" of the global system, its unipolar structure is neither historically unusual nor theoretically surprising.[160]\nworld-system theoryChristopher Chase-Dunn[158][158][159][159]balance of powerunipolarity[160][160]Randall Schweller theorized that a \"closed international system\", such as the global became a century ago, would reach \"entropy\" in a kind of thermodynamic law. Once the state of entropy is reached, there is no going back. The initial conditions are lost forever. Stressing the curiosity of the fact, Schweller writes that since the moment the modern world became a closed system, the process has worked in only one direction: from many poles to two poles to one pole. Thus unipolarity might represent the entropy\u2014stable and permanent loss of variation\u2014in the global system.[161]\nRandall Schwellerentropythermodynamic law[161][161]Present[edit]Present[edit][edit]Main article: American empireAmerican empireSee also: Pax AmericanaPax Americana Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar Al Udeid Air Base in QatarAl Udeid Air Base in QatarAl Udeid Air BaseQatarChalmers Johnson argues that the US globe-girding network of hundreds of military bases already represents a global empire in its initial form:\nChalmers Johnsonglobal empire\nFor a major power, prosecution of any war that is not a defense of the homeland usually requires overseas military bases for strategic reasons.

Being global, the system can neither expand nor be subject to external intrusion as the European states system had been for centuries:\nLudwig Dehio\nIn all previous struggles for supremacy, attempts to unite the European peninsula in a single state have been condemned to failure primarily through the intrusion of new forces from outside the old Occident. The Occident was an open area. But the globe was not, and, for that very reason, ultimately destined to be unified... And this very process [of unification] was clearly reflected in both World Wars.[175]\nIn all previous struggles for supremacy, attempts to unite the European peninsula in a single state have been condemned to failure primarily through the intrusion of new forces from outside the old Occident. The Occident was an open area. But the globe was not, and, for that very reason, ultimately destined to be unified... And this very process [of unification] was clearly reflected in both World Wars.[175][175][175]Fifteen years later, Dehio confirmed his hypothesis: The European system owed its durability to its overseas outlet. \u201cBut how can a multiple grouping of world states conceivably be supported from outside in the framework of a finite globe?\u201d[176]\n[176][176]During the same time, Quincy Wright developed a similar concept. Balance-of-power politics has aimed less at preserving peace than at preserving the independence of states and preventing the development of world empire. In the course of history, the balance of power repeatedly reemerged, but on ever-wider scale. Eventually, the scale became global. Unless we proceed to \u201cinterplanetary wars,\u201d this pattern can no longer continue. In spite of significant reversals, the \u201ctrend towards world unity\u201d can \u201cscarcely be denied.\u201d World unity appears to be \u201cthe limit toward which the process of world history seems to tend.\u201d[177]\nQuincy Wright[177][177]Five scholars\u2014Hornell Hart,[178] Raoul Naroll,[179] Louis Morano,[180] Rein Taagepera[181] and the author of the circumscription theory Robert Carneiro[182][183]\u2014researched expanding imperial cycles.\nHornell Hart[178][178]Raoul Naroll[179][179][180][180]Rein Taagepera[181][181]Robert Carneiro[182][182][183][183]The founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, writing yet in 1943, drew a more specific and immediate future imperial project: After the War America is bound \u201cto take over the command of the skies.\u201d The danger of \u201cthe utter annihilation of all enemy towns and lands\u201d can \u201conly be prevented by the air superiority of a single power ...

Coudenhove-Kalergi's follower in the teleological theory of World State, Toynbee, supposed the traditional way of universal conquest and emphasized that the world is ripe for conquest: \"...Hitler's eventual failure to impose peace on the world by the force of arms was due, not to any flaw in his thesis that the world was ripe for conquest, but to an accidental combination of incidental errors in his measures...\" But \"in falling by so narrow a margin to win the prize of world-dominion for himself, Hitler had left the prize dangling within the reach of any successor capable of pursuing the same aims of world-conquest with a little more patience, prudence, and tact.\" With his \"revolution of destruction,\" Hitler has performed the \"yeoman service\" for \"some future architect of a Pax Ecumenica... For a post-Hitlerian empire-builder, Hitler's derelict legacy was a gift of the Gods.\"[186]\nWorld StatePax Ecumenica[186][186]The next \u201carchitect of a Pax Ecumenica,\u201d known more commonly as Pax Americana, demonstrated \u201cmore patience, prudence, and tact.\u201d Consequently, as President Dwight Eisenhower put it, the NATO allies became \u201calmost psychopathic\u201d whenever anyone talked about a US withdrawal, and the reception of his successor John F. Kennedy in Berlin was \u201calmost hysterical,\u201d as Chancellor Conrad Adenauer characterized it.[187] John Ikenberry finds that the Europeans wanted a stronger, more formal and more imperial system than the United States was initially willing to provide. In the end the United States settled for this \u201cform of empire\u2014a Pax Americana with formal commitments to Europe.\u201d[188] According to a much debated thesis, the United States became \u201cempire by invitation.\u201d[189] The period discussed in the thesis (1945\u20131952) ended precisely the year Toynbee theorized on \"some future architect of a Pax Ecumenica.\u201d\nPax AmericanaDwight EisenhowerJohn F. KennedyConrad Adenauer[187][187]John Ikenberry[188][188][189][189]Dissociating America from Rome, Eisenhower gave a pessimistic forecast. In 1951, before he became President, he had written on West Europe: \u201cWe cannot be a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers with our legions if for no other reason than that these are not, politically, our frontiers. What we must do is to assist these [West European] peoples.\u201d Two years later, he wrote: When it was decided to deploy US divisions to Europe, no one had \u201cfor an instant\u201d thought that they would remain there for \u201cseveral decades\u201d\u2014that the United States could \u201cbuild a sort of Roman Wall with its own troops and so protect the world.\u201d[190]\n[190][190]Eisenhower assured Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev on Berlin in 1959: \u201cClearly we did not contemplate 50 years in occupation there.\u201d It lasted, remarks Marc Trachtenberg, from July 1945 to September 1994, 10 months short of 50 years.[191] Notably, when the US troops eventually left, they left eastward. Confirming the theory of the \u201cempire by invitation,\u201d with their first opportunity East European states extended the \u201cinvitation.\u201d[192]\nSoviet first secretaryNikita KhrushchevMarc Trachtenberg[191][191][192][192]Chalmers Johnson regards the global military reach of the United States as empire in its \u201cinitial\u201d form.[193] Dimitri Simes finds that most of the world sees the United States as a \"nascent\" imperial power.[194] Some scholars concerned how this empire would look in its ultimate form. The ultimate form of empire was described by Michael Doyle in his Empires. It is empire in which its two main components\u2014the ruling core and the ruled periphery\u2014merged to form one integrated whole. At this stage the empire as defined ceases to exist and becomes world state. Doyle examplifies the transformation on the case of the Roman Emperor Caracalla whose legislation in AD 212 extended the Roman citizenship to all inhabitants of the Mediterranean world.[195]\n[193][193]Dimitri Simes[194][194]Empiresempireworld stateCaracalla[195][195]Doyle's case of the Roman Empire had also been evoked by Susan Strange in her 1988 article, \"The Future of the American Empire.\" Strange emphasized that the most persistent empires were those which best managed to integrate the ruling core and the peripheral allies. The article is partly a reply on the published a year earlier bestseller The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers which predicted imminent US \"imperial overstretch.\" Strange found this outcome unlikely, stressing the fact that the peripheral allies have been successfully recruited into the American Empire.[196]\nSusan StrangeThe Rise and Fall of the Great Powers[196][196]Envisaging a world empire of either the United States or the Soviet Union (whoever is victorious in World War III), Bertrand Russell projected the Roman scenario too: \"Like the Romans, they will, in the course of time, extend citizenship to the vanquished. There will then be a true world state, and it will be possible to forget that it will have owed its origin to conquest.\"[197]\nBertrand Russell[197][197]To the case of Caracalla, Toynbee added the Abbasid cosmopolitan reformation of 750 AD. Both \"were good auguries for the prospect that, in a post-Modern chapter of Western history, a supranational commonwealth originally based on the hegemony of a paramount power over its satellites might eventually be put on the sounder basis of a constitutional partnership in which all the people of all the partner states would have their fare share in the conduct of common affairs.\u201d[198]\nAbbasid cosmopolitan reformation[198][198]See also[edit]See also[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}\nColonialism\nComparative studies of the Roman and Han empires\nDemocratic empire\nHegemony\nHistorical powers\nImperialism\nLinguistic imperialism\nMilitary globalization\nNomadic empire\nSoviet Empire\nWorld government\nColonialism\nComparative studies of the Roman and Han empires\nDemocratic empire\nHegemony\nHistorical powers\nImperialism\nLinguistic imperialism\nMilitary globalization\nNomadic empire\nSoviet Empire\nWorld governmentColonialismColonialismComparative studies of the Roman and Han empiresComparative studies of the Roman and Han empiresDemocratic empireDemocratic empireHegemonyHegemonyHistorical powersHistorical powersImperialismImperialismLinguistic imperialismLinguistic imperialismMilitary globalizationMilitary globalizationNomadic empireNomadic empireSoviet EmpireSoviet EmpireWorld governmentWorld governmentLists[edit]Lists[edit][edit]\nList of empires\nList of largest empires\nList of former sovereign states\nList of transcontinental countries\nList of Hindu empires and dynasties\nList of empires\nList of largest empires\nList of former sovereign states\nList of transcontinental countries\nList of Hindu empires and dynastiesList of empiresList of empiresList of largest empiresList of largest empiresList of former sovereign statesList of former sovereign statesList of transcontinental countriesList of transcontinental countriesList of Hindu empires and dynastiesList of Hindu empires and dynastiesReferences[edit]References[edit][edit]CitationsCitations.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}\n\n^ a b Howe 2002, p.\u00a030.\n\n^ a b Howe 2002, p.\u00a035.\n\n^ \"Empire\".

hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.[2] The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.[3] Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.\nA teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students  and auxiliary healthcare students. A health science  facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.\nHospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.[4]\nCurrently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.[5] In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original \"places of hospitality\", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.\n\nContents\n\n1 Etymology\n2 Types\n\n2.1 General and acute care\n2.2 District\n2.3 Specialized\n2.4 Teaching\n2.5 Clinics\n\n\n3 Departments or wards\n\n3.1 Remote monitoring\n\n\n4 History\n\n4.1 Early examples\n4.2 Middle Ages\n4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe\n4.4 19th century\n4.5 20th century and beyond\n\n\n5 Funding\n6 Quality and safety\n7 Architecture\n8 See also\n9 Notes\n10 References\n11 Bibliography\n\n11.1 History of hospitals\n\n\n12 External links\n\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\n During peacetime, hospitals can be indicated by a variety of symbols. For example, a white 'H' on a blue background is often used in the United States. During times of armed conflict, a hospital may be marked with the emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red crystal in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.\nDuring the Middle Ages, hospitals served different functions from modern institutions in that they were almshouses for the poor, hostels for pilgrims, or hospital schools. The word \"hospital\" comes from the Latin hospes, signifying a stranger or foreigner, hence a guest. Another noun derived from this, hospitium came to signify hospitality, that is the relation between guest and shelterer, hospitality, friendliness, and hospitable reception. By metonymy, the Latin word then came to mean a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an inn.[6] Hospes is thus the root for the English words host (where the p was dropped for convenience of pronunciation) hospitality, hospice, hostel, and hotel. The latter modern word derives from Latin via the Old French romance word hostel, which developed a silent s, which letter was eventually removed from the word, the loss of which is signified by a circumflex in the modern French word h\u00f4tel. The German word Spital shares similar roots.\n\nTypes[edit]\nSome patients go to a hospital just for diagnosis, treatment, or therapy and then leave (\"outpatients\") without staying overnight; while others are \"admitted\" and stay overnight or for several days or weeks or months (\"inpatients\"). Hospitals are usually distinguished from other types of medical facilities by their ability to admit and care for inpatients whilst the others, which are smaller, are often described as clinics.\n\nGeneral and acute care[edit]\n\"General hospital\" redirects here. For the American soap opera, see General Hospital.\nThe best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, also known as an acute-care hospital. These facilities handle many kinds of disease and injury, and normally have an emergency department (sometimes known as \"accident & emergency\") or trauma center to deal with immediate and urgent threats to health. Larger cities may have several hospitals of varying sizes and facilities. Some hospitals, especially in the United States and Canada, have their own ambulance service.\n\nDistrict[edit]\nMain article: Regional hospital\nA district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care, critical care, and long-term care.\nIn California, \"district hospital\" refers specifically to a class of healthcare facility created shortly after World War II to address a shortage of hospital beds in many local communities.[7][8] Even today, district hospitals are the sole public hospitals in 19 of California's counties,[7] and are the sole locally-accessible hospital within nine additional counties in which one or more other hospitals are present at a substantial distance from a local community.[7] Twenty-eight of California's rural hospitals and 20 of its critical-access hospitals are district hospitals.[8] They are formed by local municipalities, have boards that are individually elected by their local communities, and exist to serve local needs.[7][8] They are a particularly important provider of healthcare to uninsured patients and patients with Medi-Cal (which is California's Medicaid program, serving low-income persons, some senior citizens, persons with disabilities, children in foster care, and pregnant women).[7][8] In 2012, district hospitals provided $54 million in uncompensated care in California.[8]\n\nSpecialized[edit]\n Starship Children's Health is a children's hospital in Auckland, New Zealand\nA specialty hospital is primarily and exclusively dedicated to one or a few related medical specialties.[9] Subtypes include rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, long-term acute care facilities, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric problems (see psychiatric hospital), cancer treatment, certain disease categories such as cardiac, oncology, or orthopedic problems, and so forth.\nIn Germany specialised hospitals are called Fachkrankenhaus; an example is Fachkrankenhaus Coswig (thoracic surgery). In India, specialty hospitals are known as super-specialty hospitals and are distinguished from multispecialty hospitals which are composed of several specialties.[10]\nSpecialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. For example, Narayana Health's cardiac unit in Bangalore specialises in cardiac surgery and allows for a significantly greater number of patients. It has 3,000 beds and performs 3,000 in paediatric cardiac operations annually, the largest number in the world for such a facility.[3][11] Surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of per operation, thus when the number of procedures increases, the hospital is able to take advantage of economies of scale and reduce its cost per procedure.[11] Each specialist may also become more efficient by working on one procedure like a production line.[3]\n\nTeaching[edit]\nMain article: Teaching hospital\n Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami's Health District, the primary teaching hospital for the University of Miami's Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine and the largest hospital in the United States with 1,547 beds[12]\n McMaster University Medical Centre is a teaching hospital in Hamilton, Ontario\nA teaching hospital delivers healthcare to patients as well as training to prospective medical professionals such as medical students and student nurses. It may be linked to a medical school or nursing school, and may be involved in medical research. Students may also observe clinical work in the hospital.[13]\n\nClinics[edit]\nClinics generally provide only outpatient services, but some may have a few inpatient beds and a limited range of services that may otherwise be found in typical hospitals.\n\nDepartments or wards[edit]\n Hospital beds per 1000 people 2013.[14]\n Hospital beds per inhabitants\n Resuscitation room bed after a trauma intervention, showing the highly technical equipment of modern hospitals\nA hospital contains one or more wards that house hospital beds for inpatients. It may also have acute services such as an emergency department, operating theatre, and intensive care unit, as well as a range of medical specialty departments. A well-equipped hospital may be classified as a trauma center. They may also have other services such as a hospital pharmacy, radiology, pathology, and medical laboratories. Some hospitals have outpatient departments such as behavioral health services, dentistry, and rehabilitation services.\nA hospital may also have a department of nursing, headed by a chief nursing officer or director of nursing. This department is responsible for the administration of professional nursing practice, research, and policy for the hospital.\nMany units have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that unit. For example, within an intensive care nursery, a medical director is responsible for physicians and medical care, while the nursing manager is responsible for all the nurses and nursing care.\nSupport units may include a medical records department, release of information department, technical support, clinical engineering, facilities management, plant operations, dining services, and security departments.\n\nRemote monitoring[edit]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic stimulated the development of virtual wards across the British NHS.  Patients are  managed at home, monitoring their own oxygen levels using an oxygen saturation probe if necessary and supported by telephone.  West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust managed around 1200 patients at home between March and June 2020 and planned to continue the system after COVID-19, initially for respiratory patients.[15] Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust started a COVID Oximetry@Home service in April 2020.  This enables them to monitor more than 5000  patients a day in their own homes.  The technology allows nurses, carers, or patients to record and monitor vital signs such as blood oxygen levels.[16]\n\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of hospitals\nEarly examples[edit]\nSee also: Ancient Egyptian medicine, Ancient Greek medicine, Medicine in ancient Rome, and Medical community of ancient Rome\n View of the Askleipion of Kos, the best preserved instance of an Asklepieion.\nIn early India, Fa Xian, a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled across India c. AD 400, recorded examples of healing institutions.[17] According to the Mahavamsa, the ancient chronicle of Sinhalese royalty, written in the sixth century AD, King Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka (r. 437\u2013367 BC) had lying-in-homes and hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala).[18] A hospital and medical training centre also existed at Gundeshapur, a major city in southwest of the Sassanid Persian Empire founded in AD 271 by Shapur I.[19] In ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as Asclepeion functioned as centres of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.[20] The Asclepeia spread to the Roman Empire. While public healthcare was non-existent in the Roman Empire, military hospitals called valetudinaria did exist stationed in military barracks and would serve the soldiers and slaves within the fort.[21] Evidence exists that some civilian hospitals, while unavailable to the Roman population, were occasionally privately built in extremely wealthy Roman households located in the countryside for that family, although this practice seems to have ended in 80 AD.[22]\n\n Ruins of a two thousand-year-old hospital were discovered in the historical city of Anuradhapura Mihintale Sri Lanka\nMiddle Ages[edit]\nSee also: Byzantine medicine, Medieval medicine of Western Europe, and Medicine in the medieval Islamic worldThe declaration of Christianity as an accepted religion in the Roman Empire drove an expansion of the provision of care. Following the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325 construction of a hospital in every cathedral town was begun, including among the earliest hospitals by Saint Sampson in Constantinople and by Basil, bishop of Caesarea in modern-day Turkey.[23] By the twelfth century, Constantinople had two well-organised hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. Facilities included systematic treatment procedures and specialised wards for various diseases.[24] Entrance to the Qalawun complex in Cairo, Egypt which housed the notable Mansuri hospital.\nThe earliest general hospital in the Islamic world was built in 805 in Baghdad by Harun Al-Rashid.[25][26] By the 10th century, Baghdad had five more hospitals, while Damascus had six hospitals by the 15th century, and C\u00f3rdoba alone had 50 major hospitals[when?], many exclusively for the military.[27] The Islamic bimaristan served as a center of medical treatment, as well nursing home and lunatic asylum. It typically treated the poor, as the rich would have been treated in their own homes.[28] Hospitals in this era were the first to require medical diplomas to license doctors, and compensation for negligence could be made.[29][additional citation(s) needed] Hospitals were forbidden by law to turn away patients who were unable to pay.[30][need quotation to verify] These hospitals were financially supported by waqfs,[30] as well as state funds.[27]\n\nEarly modern and Enlightenment Europe[edit]\n A hospital ward in sixteenth century France.\nIn Europe the medieval concept of Christian care evolved during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into a secular one. In England, after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 by King Henry VIII, the church abruptly ceased to be the supporter of hospitals, and only by direct petition from the citizens of London, were the hospitals St Bartholomew's, St Thomas's and St Mary of Bethlehem's (Bedlam) endowed directly by the crown; this was the first instance of secular support being provided for medical institutions.\n\n 1820 Engraving of Guy's Hospital in London one of the first voluntary hospitals to be established in 1724\n Ruins of the Hospital San Nicol\u00e1s de Bari in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, recognized by UNESCO for being the oldest hospital built in the Americas.[31][32] Built between 1514 and 1541.\n Pennsylvania Hospital (now part of University of Pennsylvania Health System). Founded in 1751, it is the earliest established public hospital in the United States.[33][34][a] It is also home to America's first surgical amphitheatre and its first medical library.\nThe voluntary hospital movement began in the early 18th century, with hospitals being founded in London by the 1720s, including Westminster Hospital (1719) promoted by the private bank C. Hoare & Co and Guy's Hospital (1724) funded from the bequest of the wealthy merchant, Thomas Guy.\nOther hospitals sprang up in London and other British cities over the century, many paid for by private subscriptions. St Bartholomew's in London was rebuilt from 1730 to 1759,[35] and the London Hospital, Whitechapel, opened in 1752.\nThese hospitals represented a turning point in the function of the institution; they began to evolve from being basic places of care for the sick to becoming centres of medical innovation and discovery and the principal place for the education and training of prospective practitioners. Some of the era's greatest surgeons and doctors worked and passed on their knowledge at the hospitals.[36] They also changed from being mere homes of refuge to being complex institutions for the provision of medicine and care for sick. The Charit\u00e9 was founded in Berlin in 1710 by King Frederick I of Prussia as a response to an outbreak of plague.\nThe concept of voluntary hospitals also spread to Colonial America; the Bellevue Hospital opened in 1736 (as a workhouse, then later becoming a hospital); the Pennsylvania Hospital opened in 1752, New York Hospital[37] in 1771, and Massachusetts General Hospital in 1811.\nWhen the Vienna General Hospital opened in 1784 (instantly becoming the world's largest hospital), physicians acquired a new facility that gradually developed into one of the most important research centres.[38]\nAnother Enlightenment era charitable innovation was the dispensary; these would issue the poor with medicines free of charge. The London Dispensary opened its doors in 1696 as the first such clinic in the British Empire. The idea was slow to catch on until the 1770s,[39] when many such organisations began to appear, including the Public Dispensary of Edinburgh (1776), the Metropolitan Dispensary and Charitable Fund (1779) and the Finsbury Dispensary (1780). Dispensaries were also opened in New York 1771, Philadelphia 1786, and Boston 1796.[40]\nThe Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse, Plymouth, was a pioneer of hospital design in having \"pavilions\" to minimize the spread of infection. John Wesley visited in 1785, and commented \"I never saw anything of the kind so complete; every part is so convenient, and so admirably neat. But there is nothing superfluous, and nothing purely ornamented, either within or without.\" This revolutionary design was made more widely known by John Howard, the philanthropist. In 1787 the French government sent two scholar administrators, Coulomb and Tenon, who had visited most of the hospitals in Europe.[41] They were impressed and the \"pavilion\" design was copied in France and throughout Europe.\n\n19th century[edit]\n A ward of the hospital at Scutari where Florence Nightingale worked and helped to restructure the modern hospital\nEnglish physician Thomas Percival (1740\u20131804) wrote a comprehensive system of medical conduct, Medical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons (1803) that set the standard for many textbooks.[42] In the mid-19th century, hospitals and the medical profession became more professionalised, with a reorganisation of hospital management along more bureaucratic and administrative lines. The Apothecaries Act 1815 made it compulsory for medical students to practise for at least half a year at a hospital as part of their training.[43]\nFlorence Nightingale pioneered the modern profession of nursing during the Crimean War when she set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration. The first official nurses' training programme, the Nightingale School for Nurses, was opened in 1860, with the mission of training nurses to work in hospitals, to work with the poor and to teach.[44] Nightingale was instrumental in reforming the nature of the hospital, by improving sanitation standards and changing the image of the hospital from a place the sick would go to die, to an institution devoted to recuperation and healing. She also emphasised the importance of statistical measurement for determining the success rate of a given intervention and pushed for administrative reform at hospitals.[45]\nBy the late 19th century, the modern hospital was beginning to take shape with a proliferation of a variety of public and private hospital systems. By the 1870s, hospitals had more than trebled their original average intake of 3,000 patients. In continental Europe the new hospitals generally were built and run from public funds. The National Health Service, the principal provider of health care in the United Kingdom, was founded in 1948. During the nineteenth century, the Second Viennese Medical School emerged with the contributions of physicians such as Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky, Josef \u0160koda, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra, and Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis. Basic medical science expanded and specialisation advanced. Furthermore, the first dermatology, eye, as well as ear, nose, and throat clinics in the world were founded in Vienna, being considered as the birth of specialised medicine.[46]\n\n20th century and beyond[edit]\nThe examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (August 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nBy the late 19th and early 20th centuries, medical advancements such as anesthesia and sterile techniques that could make surgery less risky, and availability of more advanced diagnostic devices such as X-rays, continued to make hospitals a more attractive option for treatment.[47]\nModern hospitals measure various efficiency metrics such as occupancy rates, average length of stay, time to service, patient satisfaction, physician performance, patient readmission rate, inpatient mortality rate, and case mix index.[48]\nIn the United States, the number of hospitalizations in the United States continued to grow and reached its peak in 1981 with 171 admissions per 1,000 Americans and 6,933 hospitals.[47] This trend subsequently reversed, with the rate of hospitalization falling by more than 10% and the number of US hospitals shrinking from 6,933 in 1981 to 5,534 in 2016.[49] Occupancy rates also dropped from 77% in 1980 to 60% in 2013.[50] Among the reasons for this are the increasing availability of more complex care elsewhere such as at home or at the physicians' offices and also the less therapeutic and more life-threatening image of the hospitals in the eyes of the public.[47][51] In the US, a patient may sleep in a hospital bed, but be considered outpatient and \"under observation\" if not formally admitted.[52] In the US, inpatient stays are covered under Medicare Part A, but a hospital might keep a patient under observation which is only covered under Medicare Part B, and subjects the patient to additional coinsurance costs.[52] In 2013, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced a \"two-midnight\" rule for inpatient admissions,[53] intended to reduce an increasing number of long-term \"observation\" stays being used for reimbursement.[52] This rule was later dropped in 2018.[53] In 2016 and 2017, healthcare reform and a continued decline in admissions resulted in US hospital-based healthcare systems performing poorly financially.[54] Microhospitals, with bed capacities of between eight and fifty, are expanding in the United States.[55] Similarly, freestanding emergency rooms, which transfer patients that require inpatient care to hospitals, were popularised in the 1970s[56] and have since expanded rapidly across the United States.[56]\n\nFunding[edit]\n Clinical Hospital Dubrava in Zagreb, Croatia\nModern hospitals derive funding from a variety of sources. They may be funded by private payment and health insurance or public expenditure, charitable donations.\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Health Service delivers health care to legal residents funded by the state \"free at the point of delivery\", and emergency care free to anyone regardless of nationality or status. Due to the need for hospitals to prioritise their limited resources, there is a tendency in countries with such systems for 'waiting lists' for non-crucial treatment, so those who can afford it may take out private health care to access treatment more quickly.[57]\nIn the United States, hospitals typically operate privately and in some cases on a for-profit basis, such as HCA Healthcare.[58] The list of procedures and their prices are billed with a chargemaster; however, these prices may be lower for health care obtained within healthcare networks.[59] Legislation requires hospitals to provide care to patients in life-threatening emergency situations regardless of the patient's ability to pay.[60] Privately funded hospitals which admit uninsured patients in emergency situations incur direct financial losses, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.[58]\n\nQuality and safety[edit]\nAs the quality of health care has increasingly become an issue around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality is one of the most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission from the US, the Trent Accreditation Scheme from Great Britain, and the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 (HAS) from France.  In England hospitals are monitored by the Care Quality Commission. In 2020 they turned their attention to hospital food standards after  seven patient deaths from listeria linked to pre-packaged sandwiches and salads in 2019, saying \"Nutrition and hydration is part of a patient\u2019s recovery.\"[61]\nThe World Health Organization noted in 2011 that going into hospital was far riskier than flying.  Globally the chance of a patient being subject to an error was about 10%  and the chance of death resulting from an error was about 1 in 300 according to Liam Donaldson. 7% of hospitalised patients in developed countries, and 10% in developing countries, acquire at least one health care-associated infection. In the USA 1.7 million infections are acquired in hospital each year, leading to 100,000 deaths, figures much worse than in Europe where there were 4.5 million infections and 37,000 deaths.[62]\n\nArchitecture[edit]\n The medical center at the University of Virginia shows the growing trend for modern architecture in hospitals.\n The National Health Service Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the UK, showing the utilitarian architecture of many modern hospitals\n Hospital chapel at Fawcett Memorial Hospital (Port Charlotte, Florida)\nModern hospital buildings are designed to minimise the effort of medical personnel and the possibility of contamination while maximising the efficiency of the whole system. Travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients between units is facilitated and minimised. The building also should be built to accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for special wiring, plumbing, and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design.[63]\nHowever, many hospitals, even those considered \"modern\", are the product of continual and often badly managed growth over decades or even centuries, with utilitarian new sections added on as needs and finances dictate. As a result, Dutch architectural historian Cor Wagenaar has called many hospitals:\n\n\"...\u00a0built catastrophes, anonymous institutional complexes run by vast bureaucracies, and totally unfit for the purpose they have been designed for\u00a0... They are hardly ever functional, and instead of making patients feel at home, they produce stress and anxiety.\"[64]\nSome newer hospitals now try to re-establish design that takes the patient's psychological needs into account, such as providing more fresh air, better views and more pleasant colour schemes. These ideas harken back to the late eighteenth century, when the concept of providing fresh air and access to the 'healing powers of nature' were first employed by hospital architects in improving their buildings.[64]\nThe research of British Medical Association is showing that good hospital design can reduce patient's recovery time. Exposure to daylight is effective in reducing depression.[citation needed] Single-sex accommodation help ensure that patients are treated in privacy and with dignity. Exposure to nature and hospital gardens is also important \u2013 looking out windows improves patients' moods and reduces blood pressure and stress level. Open windows in patient rooms have also demonstrated some evidence of beneficial outcomes by improving airflow and increased microbial diversity.[65][66] Eliminating long corridors can reduce nurses' fatigue and stress.[67]\nAnother ongoing major development is the change from a ward-based system (where patients are accommodated in communal rooms, separated by movable partitions) to one in which they are accommodated in individual rooms. The ward-based system has been described as very efficient, especially for the medical staff, but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to their privacy. A major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital; this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms.[68]\n\n\n\n\n\nHinduja National Hospital, Mumbai\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intensive care unit (ICU) within a hospital\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniklinikum Aachen in Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTampere University Hospital in Tampere, Finland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, India\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nBurn center\nHistory of hospitals\nHistory of medicine\nHospital network\nLists of hospitals\nHospital information system\nTrauma center\nThe Waiting Room\nHospice\nWalk-in clinic\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Although Philadelphia General Hospital (1732) and Bellevue Hospital in New York (1736) are older, the Philadelphia General was founded as an almshouse, and Bellevue as a workhouse.\"\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Royal Brompton Hospital ranked in world's top ten hospitals for cardiology\".

PMID\u00a019099050. Although physicians were available in varying capacities in ancient Rome and Athens, the institution of a hospital dedicated to the care of the sick was a distinctly Christian innovation rooted in the monastic virtue and practise of hospitality. Arranged around the monastery were concentric rings of buildings in which the life and work of the monastic community was ordered. The outer ring of buildings served as a hostel in which travellers were received and boarded. The inner ring served as a place where the monastic community could care for the sick, the poor and the infirm. Monks were frequently familiar with the medicine available at that time, growing medicinal plants on the monastery grounds and applying remedies as indicated. As such, many of the practicing physicians of the Middle Ages were also clergy.\n\n^ Lovoll, Odd (1998). A Portrait of Norwegian Americans Today. U of Minnesota Press. p.\u00a0192.

specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.[2] The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.[3] Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.\nhospitalhealth carepatienthealth science[2][2]emergency departmentintensive caretrauma centersrehabilitation hospitalschildren's hospitalsgeriatricpsychiatricpsychiatric hospitalhealth care costs[3][3]A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students  and auxiliary healthcare students. A health science  facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.\nteaching hospitalhealth scienceauxiliary healthcareclinicsurgeryurgent carecardiologyoutpatient departmentspharmacypathologyradiologyHospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.[4]\npublic fundingfor-profitnonprofithealth insurancecharitiesreligious orders[4][4]Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.[5] In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original \"places of hospitality\", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.\nphysicianssurgeonsnursesallied health practitionersvolunteersAlexiansBon Secours Sisters[5][5]Royal Hospital Chelsea.mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents\n\n1 Etymology\n2 Types\n\n2.1 General and acute care\n2.2 District\n2.3 Specialized\n2.4 Teaching\n2.5 Clinics\n\n\n3 Departments or wards\n\n3.1 Remote monitoring\n\n\n4 History\n\n4.1 Early examples\n4.2 Middle Ages\n4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe\n4.4 19th century\n4.5 20th century and beyond\n\n\n5 Funding\n6 Quality and safety\n7 Architecture\n8 See also\n9 Notes\n10 References\n11 Bibliography\n\n11.1 History of hospitals\n\n\n12 External links\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Etymology\n2 Types\n\n2.1 General and acute care\n2.2 District\n2.3 Specialized\n2.4 Teaching\n2.5 Clinics\n\n\n3 Departments or wards\n\n3.1 Remote monitoring\n\n\n4 History\n\n4.1 Early examples\n4.2 Middle Ages\n4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe\n4.4 19th century\n4.5 20th century and beyond\n\n\n5 Funding\n6 Quality and safety\n7 Architecture\n8 See also\n9 Notes\n10 References\n11 Bibliography\n\n11.1 History of hospitals\n\n\n12 External links\n\nContentsContents\n1 Etymology\n2 Types\n\n2.1 General and acute care\n2.2 District\n2.3 Specialized\n2.4 Teaching\n2.5 Clinics\n\n\n3 Departments or wards\n\n3.1 Remote monitoring\n\n\n4 History\n\n4.1 Early examples\n4.2 Middle Ages\n4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe\n4.4 19th century\n4.5 20th century and beyond\n\n\n5 Funding\n6 Quality and safety\n7 Architecture\n8 See also\n9 Notes\n10 References\n11 Bibliography\n\n11.1 History of hospitals\n\n\n12 External links\n1 Etymology1 Etymology1Etymology2 Types\n\n2.1 General and acute care\n2.2 District\n2.3 Specialized\n2.4 Teaching\n2.5 Clinics\n\n2 Types2Types\n2.1 General and acute care\n2.2 District\n2.3 Specialized\n2.4 Teaching\n2.5 Clinics\n2.1 General and acute care2.1 General and acute care2.1General and acute care2.2 District2.2 District2.2District2.3 Specialized2.3 Specialized2.3Specialized2.4 Teaching2.4 Teaching2.4Teaching2.5 Clinics2.5 Clinics2.5Clinics3 Departments or wards\n\n3.1 Remote monitoring\n\n3 Departments or wards3Departments or wards\n3.1 Remote monitoring\n3.1 Remote monitoring3.1 Remote monitoring3.1Remote monitoring4 History\n\n4.1 Early examples\n4.2 Middle Ages\n4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe\n4.4 19th century\n4.5 20th century and beyond\n\n4 History4History\n4.1 Early examples\n4.2 Middle Ages\n4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe\n4.4 19th century\n4.5 20th century and beyond\n4.1 Early examples4.1 Early examples4.1Early examples4.2 Middle Ages4.2 Middle Ages4.2Middle Ages4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe4.3 Early modern and Enlightenment Europe4.3Early modern and Enlightenment Europe4.4 19th century4.4 19th century4.419th century4.5 20th century and beyond4.5 20th century and beyond4.520th century and beyond5 Funding5 Funding5Funding6 Quality and safety6 Quality and safety6Quality and safety7 Architecture7 Architecture7Architecture8 See also8 See also8See also9 Notes9 Notes9Notes10 References10 References10References11 Bibliography\n\n11.1 History of hospitals\n\n11 Bibliography11Bibliography\n11.1 History of hospitals\n11.1 History of hospitals11.1 History of hospitals11.1History of hospitals12 External links12 External links12External linksEtymology[edit]Etymology[edit][edit] During peacetime, hospitals can be indicated by a variety of symbols. For example, a white 'H' on a blue background is often used in the United States. During times of armed conflict, a hospital may be marked with the emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red crystal in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.

The word \"hospital\" comes from the Latin hospes, signifying a stranger or foreigner, hence a guest. Another noun derived from this, hospitium came to signify hospitality, that is the relation between guest and shelterer, hospitality, friendliness, and hospitable reception. By metonymy, the Latin word then came to mean a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an inn.[6] Hospes is thus the root for the English words host (where the p was dropped for convenience of pronunciation) hospitality, hospice, hostel, and hotel. The latter modern word derives from Latin via the Old French romance word hostel, which developed a silent s, which letter was eventually removed from the word, the loss of which is signified by a circumflex in the modern French word h\u00f4tel. The German word Spital shares similar roots.\nalmshouseshostelspilgrimshospital schoolsLatinhospeshospeshospitiumhospitiummetonymyinn[6][6]HospesHospeshostphospitalityhospitalityhospicehospicehostel,hostelhotelhotelOld Frenchhostelhostelscircumflexmodern Frenchh\u00f4telh\u00f4telGermanSpitalSpitalTypes[edit]Types[edit][edit]Some patients go to a hospital just for diagnosis, treatment, or therapy and then leave (\"outpatients\") without staying overnight; while others are \"admitted\" and stay overnight or for several days or weeks or months (\"inpatients\"). Hospitals are usually distinguished from other types of medical facilities by their ability to admit and care for inpatients whilst the others, which are smaller, are often described as clinics.\npatientsdiagnosisoutpatientsinpatientsclinicsGeneral and acute care[edit]General and acute care[edit][edit]\"General hospital\" redirects here. For the American soap opera, see General Hospital.General HospitalThe best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, also known as an acute-care hospital. These facilities handle many kinds of disease and injury, and normally have an emergency department (sometimes known as \"accident & emergency\") or trauma center to deal with immediate and urgent threats to health. Larger cities may have several hospitals of varying sizes and facilities. Some hospitals, especially in the United States and Canada, have their own ambulance service.\ntrauma centerDistrict[edit]District[edit][edit]Main article: Regional hospitalRegional hospitalA district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care, critical care, and long-term care.\nintensive carecritical careIn California, \"district hospital\" refers specifically to a class of healthcare facility created shortly after World War II to address a shortage of hospital beds in many local communities.[7][8] Even today, district hospitals are the sole public hospitals in 19 of California's counties,[7] and are the sole locally-accessible hospital within nine additional counties in which one or more other hospitals are present at a substantial distance from a local community.[7] Twenty-eight of California's rural hospitals and 20 of its critical-access hospitals are district hospitals.[8] They are formed by local municipalities, have boards that are individually elected by their local communities, and exist to serve local needs.[7][8] They are a particularly important provider of healthcare to uninsured patients and patients with Medi-Cal (which is California's Medicaid program, serving low-income persons, some senior citizens, persons with disabilities, children in foster care, and pregnant women).[7][8] In 2012, district hospitals provided $54 million in uncompensated care in California.[8]\nCaliforniaWorld War II[7][7][8][8][7][7][7][7][8][8][7][7][8][8]Medi-CalMedicaidsenior citizensdisabilitiesfoster care[7][7][8][8][8][8]Specialized[edit]Specialized[edit][edit] Starship Children's Health is a children's hospital in Auckland, New Zealand Starship Children's Health is a children's hospital in Auckland, New ZealandStarship Children's Health is a children's hospital in Auckland, New ZealandStarship Children's HealthAucklandA specialty hospital is primarily and exclusively dedicated to one or a few related medical specialties.[9] Subtypes include rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, long-term acute care facilities, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric problems (see psychiatric hospital), cancer treatment, certain disease categories such as cardiac, oncology, or orthopedic problems, and so forth.\nmedical specialties[9][9]rehabilitation hospitalschildren's hospitalsgeriatriclong-term acute care facilitiespsychiatricpsychiatric hospitalcancer treatmentIn Germany specialised hospitals are called Fachkrankenhaus; an example is Fachkrankenhaus Coswig (thoracic surgery). In India, specialty hospitals are known as super-specialty hospitals and are distinguished from multispecialty hospitals which are composed of several specialties.[10]\nFachkrankenhausFachkrankenhaus Coswigsuper-specialty hospitals[10][10]Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. For example, Narayana Health's cardiac unit in Bangalore specialises in cardiac surgery and allows for a significantly greater number of patients. It has 3,000 beds and performs 3,000 in paediatric cardiac operations annually, the largest number in the world for such a facility.[3][11] Surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of per operation, thus when the number of procedures increases, the hospital is able to take advantage of economies of scale and reduce its cost per procedure.[11] Each specialist may also become more efficient by working on one procedure like a production line.[3]\nhealth care costsNarayana Health'sBangalore[3][3][11][11]economies of scale[11][11]production line[3][3]Teaching[edit]Teaching[edit][edit]Main article: Teaching hospitalTeaching hospital Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami's Health District, the primary teaching hospital for the University of Miami's Leonard M.

While public healthcare was non-existent in the Roman Empire, military hospitals called valetudinaria did exist stationed in military barracks and would serve the soldiers and slaves within the fort.[21] Evidence exists that some civilian hospitals, while unavailable to the Roman population, were occasionally privately built in extremely wealthy Roman households located in the countryside for that family, although this practice seems to have ended in 80 AD.[22]\nFa Xian[17][17]MahavamsaMahavamsaPandukabhaya of Sri Lanka[18][18]hospital and medical training centreGundeshapurSassanid Persian EmpireShapur I[19][19]ancient GreeceAsclepiusAsclepeion[20][20]Roman Empirevaletudinaria[21][21][22][22] Ruins of a two thousand-year-old hospital were discovered in the historical city of Anuradhapura Mihintale Sri Lanka Ruins of a two thousand-year-old hospital were discovered in the historical city of Anuradhapura Mihintale Sri LankaRuins of a two thousand-year-old hospital were discovered in the historical city of Anuradhapura Mihintale Sri LankaAnuradhapuraMihintaleSri LankaMiddle Ages[edit]Middle Ages[edit][edit]See also: Byzantine medicine, Medieval medicine of Western Europe, and Medicine in the medieval Islamic worldByzantine medicineMedieval medicine of Western EuropeMedicine in the medieval Islamic worldThe declaration of Christianity as an accepted religion in the Roman Empire drove an expansion of the provision of care. Following the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325 construction of a hospital in every cathedral town was begun, including among the earliest hospitals by Saint Sampson in Constantinople and by Basil, bishop of Caesarea in modern-day Turkey.[23] By the twelfth century, Constantinople had two well-organised hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. Facilities included systematic treatment procedures and specialised wards for various diseases.[24]ChristianityFirst Council of NicaeacathedralSaint SampsonConstantinopleBasil, bishop of Caesarea[23][23][24][24] Entrance to the Qalawun complex in Cairo, Egypt which housed the notable Mansuri hospital.

It typically treated the poor, as the rich would have been treated in their own homes.[28] Hospitals in this era were the first to require medical diplomas to license doctors, and compensation for negligence could be made.[29][additional citation(s) needed] Hospitals were forbidden by law to turn away patients who were unable to pay.[30][need quotation to verify] These hospitals were financially supported by waqfs,[30] as well as state funds.[27]\nBaghdadHarun Al-Rashid[25][25][26][26]DamascusC\u00f3rdoba[when?]when?when?when?[27][27]bimaristanbimaristannursing homelunatic asylum[28][28][29][29][additional citation(s) needed]additional citation(s) neededadditional citation(s) neededadditional citation(s) needed[30][30][need quotation to verify]need quotation to verifyneed quotation to verifyneed quotation to verifywaqfs[30][30][27][27]Early modern and Enlightenment Europe[edit]Early modern and Enlightenment Europe[edit][edit] A hospital ward in sixteenth century France.

St Bartholomew's in London was rebuilt from 1730 to 1759,[35] and the London Hospital, Whitechapel, opened in 1752.\n[35][35]These hospitals represented a turning point in the function of the institution; they began to evolve from being basic places of care for the sick to becoming centres of medical innovation and discovery and the principal place for the education and training of prospective practitioners. Some of the era's greatest surgeons and doctors worked and passed on their knowledge at the hospitals.[36] They also changed from being mere homes of refuge to being complex institutions for the provision of medicine and care for sick. The Charit\u00e9 was founded in Berlin in 1710 by King Frederick I of Prussia as a response to an outbreak of plague.\neducationsurgeons[36][36]Charit\u00e9Frederick I of PrussiaThe concept of voluntary hospitals also spread to Colonial America; the Bellevue Hospital opened in 1736 (as a workhouse, then later becoming a hospital); the Pennsylvania Hospital opened in 1752, New York Hospital[37] in 1771, and Massachusetts General Hospital in 1811.\nColonial AmericaBellevue HospitalPennsylvania HospitalNew York Hospital[37][37]Massachusetts General HospitalWhen the Vienna General Hospital opened in 1784 (instantly becoming the world's largest hospital), physicians acquired a new facility that gradually developed into one of the most important research centres.[38]\nVienna General Hospital[38][38]Another Enlightenment era charitable innovation was the dispensary; these would issue the poor with medicines free of charge. The London Dispensary opened its doors in 1696 as the first such clinic in the British Empire. The idea was slow to catch on until the 1770s,[39] when many such organisations began to appear, including the Public Dispensary of Edinburgh (1776), the Metropolitan Dispensary and Charitable Fund (1779) and the Finsbury Dispensary (1780). Dispensaries were also opened in New York 1771, Philadelphia 1786, and Boston 1796.[40]\nEnlightenmentmedicinesBritish Empire[39][39]Public Dispensary of EdinburghFinsbury DispensaryPhiladelphia[40][40]The Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse, Plymouth, was a pioneer of hospital design in having \"pavilions\" to minimize the spread of infection. John Wesley visited in 1785, and commented \"I never saw anything of the kind so complete; every part is so convenient, and so admirably neat. But there is nothing superfluous, and nothing purely ornamented, either within or without.\" This revolutionary design was made more widely known by John Howard, the philanthropist. In 1787 the French government sent two scholar administrators, Coulomb and Tenon, who had visited most of the hospitals in Europe.[41] They were impressed and the \"pavilion\" design was copied in France and throughout Europe.\nRoyal Naval Hospital, StonehousePlymouthJohn WesleyJohn HowardCoulombTenon[41][41]19th century[edit]19th century[edit][edit] A ward of the hospital at Scutari where Florence Nightingale worked and helped to restructure the modern hospital A ward of the hospital at Scutari where Florence Nightingale worked and helped to restructure the modern hospitalA ward of the hospital at Scutari where Florence Nightingale worked and helped to restructure the modern hospitalScutariFlorence NightingaleEnglish physician Thomas Percival (1740\u20131804) wrote a comprehensive system of medical conduct, Medical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons (1803) that set the standard for many textbooks.[42] In the mid-19th century, hospitals and the medical profession became more professionalised, with a reorganisation of hospital management along more bureaucratic and administrative lines. The Apothecaries Act 1815 made it compulsory for medical students to practise for at least half a year at a hospital as part of their training.[43]\nThomas PercivalMedical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and SurgeonsMedical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons[42][42]Apothecaries Act 1815[43][43]Florence Nightingale pioneered the modern profession of nursing during the Crimean War when she set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration. The first official nurses' training programme, the Nightingale School for Nurses, was opened in 1860, with the mission of training nurses to work in hospitals, to work with the poor and to teach.[44] Nightingale was instrumental in reforming the nature of the hospital, by improving sanitation standards and changing the image of the hospital from a place the sick would go to die, to an institution devoted to recuperation and healing. She also emphasised the importance of statistical measurement for determining the success rate of a given intervention and pushed for administrative reform at hospitals.[45]\nFlorence NightingalenursingCrimean War[44][44]sanitationstatistical measurementadministrative reform[45][45]By the late 19th century, the modern hospital was beginning to take shape with a proliferation of a variety of public and private hospital systems. By the 1870s, hospitals had more than trebled their original average intake of 3,000 patients. In continental Europe the new hospitals generally were built and run from public funds. The National Health Service, the principal provider of health care in the United Kingdom, was founded in 1948. During the nineteenth century, the Second Viennese Medical School emerged with the contributions of physicians such as Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky, Josef \u0160koda, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra, and Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis. Basic medical science expanded and specialisation advanced. Furthermore, the first dermatology, eye, as well as ear, nose, and throat clinics in the world were founded in Vienna, being considered as the birth of specialised medicine.[46]\nNational Health ServiceCarl Freiherr von RokitanskyJosef \u0160kodaFerdinand Ritter von HebraIgnaz Philipp SemmelweisVienna[46][46]20th century and beyond[edit]20th century and beyond[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .ambox{border:1px solid #a2a9b1;border-left:10px solid #36c;background-color:#fbfbfb;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+link+.ambox{margin-top:-1px}html body.mediawiki .mw-parser-output .ambox.mbox-small-left{margin:4px 1em 4px 0;overflow:hidden;width:238px;border-collapse:collapse;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em}.mw-parser-output .ambox-speedy{border-left:10px solid #b32424;background-color:#fee7e6}.mw-parser-output .ambox-delete{border-left:10px solid #b32424}.mw-parser-output .ambox-content{border-left:10px solid #f28500}.mw-parser-output .ambox-style{border-left:10px solid #fc3}.mw-parser-output .ambox-move{border-left:10px solid #9932cc}.mw-parser-output .ambox-protection{border-left:10px solid #a2a9b1}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-text{border:none;padding:0.25em 0.5em;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image{border:none;padding:2px 0 2px 0.5em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-imageright{border:none;padding:2px 0.5em 2px 0;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-empty-cell{border:none;padding:0;width:1px}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image-div{width:52px}html.client-js body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .mbox-text-span{margin-left:23px!important}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .ambox{margin:0 10%}}The examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject.

Due to the need for hospitals to prioritise their limited resources, there is a tendency in countries with such systems for 'waiting lists' for non-crucial treatment, so those who can afford it may take out private health care to access treatment more quickly.[57]\nNational Health Service[57][57]In the United States, hospitals typically operate privately and in some cases on a for-profit basis, such as HCA Healthcare.[58] The list of procedures and their prices are billed with a chargemaster; however, these prices may be lower for health care obtained within healthcare networks.[59] Legislation requires hospitals to provide care to patients in life-threatening emergency situations regardless of the patient's ability to pay.[60] Privately funded hospitals which admit uninsured patients in emergency situations incur direct financial losses, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.[58]\nfor-profitHCA Healthcare[58][58]chargemasterhealthcare networks[59][59][60][60]Hurricane Katrina[58][58]Quality and safety[edit]Quality and safety[edit][edit]As the quality of health care has increasingly become an issue around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality is one of the most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission from the US, the Trent Accreditation Scheme from Great Britain, and the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 (HAS) from France.  In England hospitals are monitored by the Care Quality Commission. In 2020 they turned their attention to hospital food standards after  seven patient deaths from listeria linked to pre-packaged sandwiches and salads in 2019, saying \"Nutrition and hydration is part of a patient\u2019s recovery.\"[61]\nhospital accreditationinternational healthcare accreditationAccreditation CanadaJoint CommissionTrent Accreditation SchemeHaute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9Care Quality Commissionhospital food[61][61]The World Health Organization noted in 2011 that going into hospital was far riskier than flying.  Globally the chance of a patient being subject to an error was about 10%  and the chance of death resulting from an error was about 1 in 300 according to Liam Donaldson. 7% of hospitalised patients in developed countries, and 10% in developing countries, acquire at least one health care-associated infection. In the USA 1.7 million infections are acquired in hospital each year, leading to 100,000 deaths, figures much worse than in Europe where there were 4.5 million infections and 37,000 deaths.[62]\nWorld Health OrganizationLiam Donaldsonhealth care-associated infection[62][62]Architecture[edit]Architecture[edit][edit] The medical center at the University of Virginia shows the growing trend for modern architecture in hospitals.

Travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients between units is facilitated and minimised. The building also should be built to accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for special wiring, plumbing, and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design.[63]\n[63][63]However, many hospitals, even those considered \"modern\", are the product of continual and often badly managed growth over decades or even centuries, with utilitarian new sections added on as needs and finances dictate. As a result, Dutch architectural historian Cor Wagenaar has called many hospitals:\nCor Wagenaar\"...\u00a0built catastrophes, anonymous institutional complexes run by vast bureaucracies, and totally unfit for the purpose they have been designed for\u00a0... They are hardly ever functional, and instead of making patients feel at home, they produce stress and anxiety.\"[64]\"...\u00a0built catastrophes, anonymous institutional complexes run by vast bureaucracies, and totally unfit for the purpose they have been designed for\u00a0...

They are hardly ever functional, and instead of making patients feel at home, they produce stress and anxiety.\"[64][64][64]Some newer hospitals now try to re-establish design that takes the patient's psychological needs into account, such as providing more fresh air, better views and more pleasant colour schemes. These ideas harken back to the late eighteenth century, when the concept of providing fresh air and access to the 'healing powers of nature' were first employed by hospital architects in improving their buildings.[64]\n[64][64]The research of British Medical Association is showing that good hospital design can reduce patient's recovery time. Exposure to daylight is effective in reducing depression.[citation needed] Single-sex accommodation help ensure that patients are treated in privacy and with dignity. Exposure to nature and hospital gardens is also important \u2013 looking out windows improves patients' moods and reduces blood pressure and stress level. Open windows in patient rooms have also demonstrated some evidence of beneficial outcomes by improving airflow and increased microbial diversity.[65][66] Eliminating long corridors can reduce nurses' fatigue and stress.[67]\nBritish Medical Association[citation needed]citation neededcitation neededcitation needed[65][65][66][66][67][67]Another ongoing major development is the change from a ward-based system (where patients are accommodated in communal rooms, separated by movable partitions) to one in which they are accommodated in individual rooms. The ward-based system has been described as very efficient, especially for the medical staff, but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to their privacy. A major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital; this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms.[68]\n[68][68]\n\n\n\nHinduja National Hospital, Mumbai\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intensive care unit (ICU) within a hospital\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniklinikum Aachen in Germany\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTampere University Hospital in Tampere, Finland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, India\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHinduja National Hospital, Mumbai\n\n\n\n\n\nHinduja National Hospital, Mumbai\n\n\n\nHinduja National Hospital, Mumbai\n\nHinduja National Hospital, Mumbai\nHinduja National Hospital, Mumbai\n\n\nAn intensive care unit (ICU) within a hospital\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intensive care unit (ICU) within a hospital\n\n\n\nAn intensive care unit (ICU) within a hospital\n\nAn intensive care unit (ICU) within a hospital\nintensive care unit\n\n\nUniklinikum Aachen in Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nUniklinikum Aachen in Germany\n\n\n\nUniklinikum Aachen in Germany\n\nUniklinikum Aachen in Germany\nUniklinikum Aachen\n\n\nTampere University Hospital in Tampere, Finland\n\n\n\n\n\nTampere University Hospital in Tampere, Finland\n\n\n\nTampere University Hospital in Tampere, Finland\n\nTampere University Hospital in Tampere, Finland\nTampere University HospitalTampere\n\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, India\n\n\n\n\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, India\n\n\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, India\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, India\nAll India Institute of Medical SciencesDelhi\n\n\nLehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\nLehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nLehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\nLehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania\nLehigh Valley HospitalAllentown, PennsylvaniaSee also[edit]See also[edit][edit]Burn center\nHistory of hospitals\nHistory of medicine\nHospital network\nLists of hospitals\nHospital information system\nTrauma center\nThe Waiting Room\nHospice\nWalk-in clinicBurn centerBurn centerHistory of hospitalsHistory of hospitalsHistory of medicineHistory of medicineHospital networkHospital networkLists of hospitalsLists of hospitalsHospital information systemHospital information systemTrauma centerTrauma centerThe Waiting RoomThe Waiting RoomHospiceHospiceWalk-in clinicWalk-in clinicNotes[edit]Notes[edit][edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}\n\n^ \"Although Philadelphia General Hospital (1732) and Bellevue Hospital in New York (1736) are older, the Philadelphia General was founded as an almshouse, and Bellevue as a workhouse.\"\n\n\n^ \"Although Philadelphia General Hospital (1732) and Bellevue Hospital in New York (1736) are older, the Philadelphia General was founded as an almshouse, and Bellevue as a workhouse.\"\n\n\n^ \"Although Philadelphia General Hospital (1732) and Bellevue Hospital in New York (1736) are older, the Philadelphia General was founded as an almshouse, and Bellevue as a workhouse.\"\n\n^ \"Although Philadelphia General Hospital (1732) and Bellevue Hospital in New York (1736) are older, the Philadelphia General was founded as an almshouse, and Bellevue as a workhouse.\"\n^^^\"Although Philadelphia General Hospital (1732) and Bellevue Hospital in New York (1736) are older, the Philadelphia General was founded as an almshouse, and Bellevue as a workhouse.\"References[edit]References[edit][edit]\n\n^ \"Royal Brompton Hospital ranked in world's top ten hospitals for cardiology\".

Although physicians were available in varying capacities in ancient Rome and Athens, the institution of a hospital dedicated to the care of the sick was a distinctly Christian innovation rooted in the monastic virtue and practise of hospitality. Arranged around the monastery were concentric rings of buildings in which the life and work of the monastic community was ordered. The outer ring of buildings served as a hostel in which travellers were received and boarded. The inner ring served as a place where the monastic community could care for the sick, the poor and the infirm. Monks were frequently familiar with the medicine available at that time, growing medicinal plants on the monastery grounds and applying remedies as indicated.

Etymology\n2 History\n3 Men who never married\n4 Bachelorette\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\nEtymology[edit]\nA bachelor is first attested as the 12th-century bacheler: a knight bachelor, a knight too young or poor to gather vassals under his own banner.[2] The Old French bacheler presumably derives from Proven\u00e7al bacalar and Italian baccalare,[2] but the ultimate source of the word is uncertain.[3][2] The proposed Medieval Latin *baccalaris (\"vassal\", \"field hand\") is only attested late enough that it may have derived from the vernacular languages,[2] rather than from the southern French and northern Spanish Latin[3] baccalaria.[4] Alternatively, it has been derived from Latin baculum (\"a stick\"), in reference to the wooden sticks used by knights in training.[5][6]\nIn certain Gulf Arab countries, \"bachelor\" can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite),[7] and a colloquial term \"executive bachelor\" is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to white-collar bachelors in particular.[8][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nHistory[edit]\nFrom the 14th century, the term \"bachelor\" was also used for a junior member of a guild (otherwise known as \"yeomen\") or university and then for low-level ecclesiastics, as young monks and recently appointed canons.[9] As an inferior grade of scholarship, it came to refer to one holding a \"bachelor's degree\". This sense of baccalarius or baccalaureus is first attested at the University of Paris in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of Pope Gregory IX as applied to scholars still in statu pupillari. There were two classes of baccalarii: the baccalarii cursores, theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the baccalarii dispositi, who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.[10]\nIn the Victorian era, the term \"eligible bachelor\" was used in the context of upper class matchmaking, denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered \"eligible\" in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term \"confirmed bachelor\" denoted a man who desired to remain single.\nBy the later 19th century, the term \"bachelor\" had acquired the general sense of \"unmarried man\". The expression bachelor party is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent \"bachelor-girl\" was coined, replaced in US English by \"bachelorette\" by the mid-1930s. This terminology is now generally seen as antiquated, and has been largely replaced by the gender-neutral term \"single\" (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term \"bachelor\" remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favor of \"single.\"[11]\nBachelors have been subject to penal laws in many countries, most notably in Ancient Sparta and Rome.[3] At Sparta, men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties (Greek: \u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, atim\u00eda): they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics; during the winter, they were made to march naked through the agora singing a song about their dishonor;[3] and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly.[12] Some Athenian laws were similar.[13]\nOver time, some punishments developed into no more than a teasing game. In some parts of Germany, for instance, men who were still unmarried by their 30th birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the town hall until kissed by a \"virgin\".[14] In a 1912 Pittsburgh Press article, there was a suggestion that local bachelors should wear a special pin that identified them as such, or a black necktie to symbolize that \"....they [bachelors] should be in perpetual mourning because they are so foolish as to stay unmarried and deprive themselves of the comforts of a wife and home.\"[15]\nThe idea of a tax on bachelors has existed throughout the centuries. Bachelors in Rome fell under the Lex Julia of 18\u00a0BC and the Lex Papia Poppaea of AD\u00a09: these lay heavy fines on unmarried or childless people while providing certain privileges to those with several children.[3] In 1695, a law known as the Marriage Duty Act was imposed on single males over 25 years old by the English Crown to help generate income for the Nine Years' War.[16] In Britain, taxes occasionally fell heavier on bachelors than other persons: examples include 6 & 7 Will. III, the 1785 Tax on Servants, and the 1798 Income Tax.[3]\nA study that was conducted by professor Charles Waehler at the University of Akron in Ohio on non-married heterosexual males deduced that once non-married men hit middle age, they will be less likely to marry and remain unattached later into their lives.[17] The study concluded that there is only a 1-in-6 chance that men older than 40 will leave the single life, and that after the age 45, the odds fall to 1-in-20.[17]\n\nMen who never married[edit]\nListed chronologically by date of birth.\n\n\n\nAncient Period\n\nMedieval Period, Renaissance, and Early Enlightenment\n\nLate Enlightenment, Modern, and Post-modern\n\n\nJeremiah[18]\n\nAquinas\n\nVivaldi\n\n\nHeraclitus\n\nPetrarch[19]\n\nHandel[20]\n\n\nGorgias[21]\n\nLeonardo[22]\n\nPope[23]\n\n\nDemocritus[24]\n\nErasmus[25]\n\nVoltaire[26]\n\n\nPlato[27]\n\nCopernicus[28]\n\nBayes[29]\n\n\nEpicurus[30]\n\nRaphael[31]\n\nHume[32]\n\n\nHorace[33]\n\nGilbert[34]\n\nd'Alembert[35]\n\n\nJesus[36]\n\nBrahe[28]\n\nSmith[37]\n\n\nEpictetus[38]\n\nGalileo[39]\n\nKant[40]\n\n\nPlotinus[41]\n\nHobbes[42]\n\nGibbon[43]\n\n\nAugustine[44]\n\nDescartes[45]\n\nFourier[46]\n\n\n\nTorricelli[47]\n\nBeethoven[48]\n\n\n\nPascal[49]\n\nLewis[50]\n\n\n\nBoyle[51]\n\nSchopenhauer[52]\n\n\n\nHuygens[53]\n\nBuchanan[54]\n\n\n\nBarrow[55]\n\nSchubert[56]\n\n\n\nLocke[57]\n\nChopin[58]\n\n\n\nSpinoza[59]\n\nLiszt[60]\n\n\n\nHooke[61]\n\nKierkegaard[62]\n\n\n\nNewton[63]\n\nSpencer[64]\n\n\n\nLeibniz[65]\n\nThoreau[66]\n\n\n\nBayle[67]\n\nBrahms[68]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobel[69]\n\n\n\n\nDegas[70]\n\n\n\n\nGibbs[71]\n\n\n\n\nJames[72]\n\n\n\n\nNietzsche[73]\n\n\n\n\nVan Gogh[74]\n\n\n\n\nEastman[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla[76]\n\n\n\n\nWright Brothers[77]\n\n\n\n\nMondrian[78]\n\n\n\n\nKafka[79]\n\n\n\n\nSartre[80]\n\n\n\n\nGould[81]\n\n\n\n\nMattis[82]\n\nBachelorette[edit]\nThe term bachelorette[83] is sometimes used to refer to a woman who has never been married.\nThe traditional female equivalent to bachelor is spinster, which is considered pejorative and implies unattractiveness (i.e. old maid, cat lady).[83] The term \"bachelorette\" has been used in its place, particularly in the context of bachelorette parties and reality TV series The Bachlorette.[84]\n\nSee also[edit]\nBachelor pad\nMen Going Their Own Way\nSpinster\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Bachelors are, in Pitt & al.'s phrasing, \"men who live independently, outside of their parents' home and other institutional settings, who are neither married nor cohabitating\".

This sense of baccalarius or baccalaureus is first attested at the University of Paris in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of Pope Gregory IX as applied to scholars still in statu pupillari. There were two classes of baccalarii: the baccalarii cursores, theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the baccalarii dispositi, who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.[10]\nguilduniversitymonkscanons[9][9]bachelor's degreebaccalariusbaccalariusbaccalariusbaccalaureusbaccalaureusbaccalaureusUniversity of ParisPope Gregory IXin statu pupillariin statu pupillariin statu pupillaribaccalariibaccalariibaccalariibaccalarii cursoresbaccalarii cursoresbaccalarii cursoresbaccalarii dispositibaccalarii dispositibaccalarii dispositi[10][10]In the Victorian era, the term \"eligible bachelor\" was used in the context of upper class matchmaking, denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered \"eligible\" in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term \"confirmed bachelor\" denoted a man who desired to remain single.\nVictorian eraeligible bachelorupper classmatchmakingconfirmed bachelorBy the later 19th century, the term \"bachelor\" had acquired the general sense of \"unmarried man\". The expression bachelor party is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent \"bachelor-girl\" was coined, replaced in US English by \"bachelorette\" by the mid-1930s. This terminology is now generally seen as antiquated, and has been largely replaced by the gender-neutral term \"single\" (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term \"bachelor\" remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favor of \"single.\"[11]\nBachelors have been subject to penal laws in many countries, most notably in Ancient Sparta and Rome.[3] At Sparta, men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties (Greek: \u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, atim\u00eda): they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics; during the winter, they were made to march naked through the agora singing a song about their dishonor;[3] and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly.[12] Some Athenian laws were similar.[13]\nbachelor partybachelorettegender-neutral termsingle[11][11]penal lawsAncientSpartaRome[3][3]Greek\u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1atim\u00edaagora[3][3][12][12]Athenian[13][13]Over time, some punishments developed into no more than a teasing game. In some parts of Germany, for instance, men who were still unmarried by their 30th birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the town hall until kissed by a \"virgin\".[14] In a 1912 Pittsburgh Press article, there was a suggestion that local bachelors should wear a special pin that identified them as such, or a black necktie to symbolize that \"....they [bachelors] should be in perpetual mourning because they are so foolish as to stay unmarried and deprive themselves of the comforts of a wife and home.\"[15]\ntown hall[14][14]Pittsburgh Press[15][15]The idea of a tax on bachelors has existed throughout the centuries.

Charles Waehler at the University of Akron in Ohio on non-married heterosexual males deduced that once non-married men hit middle age, they will be less likely to marry and remain unattached later into their lives.[17] The study concluded that there is only a 1-in-6 chance that men older than 40 will leave the single life, and that after the age 45, the odds fall to 1-in-20.[17]\nUniversity of
